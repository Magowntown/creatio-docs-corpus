  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nYou can improve security of Creatio by not storing sensitive data in the configuration files. Use [Vault by HashiCorp](https://www.vaultproject.io/) designed for secure storage and management of sensitive data. Sensitive data include:\n* passwords\n* usernames\n* API keys\n* access tokens\nYou can use a secure Vault storage for your connection parameters normally stored in the ConnectionStrings.config file:\n* Creatio databases\n* Quartz (if stored in a separate DB)\n* Redis\n* s3Connection\n* ElasticSearch\n* influx\n* MessageBroker\nYou can move the connection parameters to Vault during [deployment](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/category/on-site-deployment) or in a deployed environment.\nVault uses secrets to store sensitive data. Secrets are written to Secrets Engines: storages of secrets. There are several types of Secrets Engines. Use the key-value (KV version 2) Secrets Engine type for the storage of sensitive Creatio data. This will enable you to store sensitive information as key-value pairs. The value is the sensitive information, while the key must be specified in the ConnectionString.config file of your Creatio server. You can also store encryption keys (AES) in Vault.\nnote\nYou can further configure Vault to track versioned key-value pairs.\nFig. 1 Interaction diagram for Creatio and Vault\n![Fig. 1 Interaction diagram for Creatio and Vault](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/vault/vault_creatio_scheme.png)\nThe general procedure for Vault connection and setup is as follows:\n1. Steps on the Vault side:\n1. Deploy and run the Vault server.\n2. Create secret keys.\n3. Set up the security policy.\n4. Set up the authorization parameters.\n2. Steps on the Creatio side:\n1. Set up Vault connection parameters.\n2. Set up the string in ConnectionString.config.\n3. Enable the flags.\n4. Restart Creatio.\nLet\u2019s consider these steps in more detail.\n## Steps on the Vault side\u200b\n### Deploy and run the Vault server\u200b\nRun the Vault server in production mode before use. You can deploy Vault both on a dedicated server and a server with other Creatio components, guided by the general [server-side system requirements](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1456). This can be done during the deployment of Creatio or at a later stage.\nDeploy the Vault server on a Linux/Windows machine and enable HTTPS. Use the server certificate stored on the same machine as the Vault server to configure HTTPS. The certificate can be issued and signed by any trusted CA.\nImportant\nStore the private key for the server certificate in a protected directory.\nThe Vault documentation covers deployment and launch in more detail:\n1. [Installation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-install).\n2. [Configuration](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/configure-vault).\n3. First [start](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/server).\n4. [Initialization](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init) after the first start.\nnote\nSave the unseal keys and token generated during the initialization. This is required to ensure starting the server is safe and start it with administrator privileges.\nActions performed each time the Vault server is restarted:\n1. [Restart](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/server).\n2. [Unsealing](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal) using the unseal keys generated during the initialization.\n### Create a storage for secret keys\u200b\nUse the key-value (KV version 2) Secrets Engine for the storage of secrets.\nVault can store versioned sensitive data in specialized storages (Secrets Engines). Each secrets engine has a unique path as an attribute required for connection. We recommend using your website\u2019s name as the path for the storage of sensitive Creatio data.\n1. Go to the **Secrets** section in the Vault UI.\n2. Create a key-value secrets engine. We recommend using the name of the product for which the secrets are created as the name of the secrets engine. For example, Creatio. Learn more about creating a secrets engine in the [Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2).\nA secrets engine can hold several secrets, each corresponding to a specific connection string or encryption key. Specify a unique path to each secret in the secrets engine. A single secret can hold multiple key-value pairs, each pair meant for a different type of sensitive data. For example, a login and its password are stored in Vault as two key-value pairs,\n### Create secret keys\u200b\nTo create private keys for the database connection string in the ConnectionString.config file:\n1. Go to the **Secrets** section in the Vault UI.\n2. Open the secrets engine you created.\n3. Specify the Path to the secret. To connect to the database, as well as to Redis, the path to sensitive data must match the name of the corresponding connection string in ConnectionStrings.config. For example, if you are using PostgreSql, specify dbPostgreSql in the database connection string.\n4. Configure other connection strings that contain sensitive data in the same way.\n5. In each secret that has a matching connection string, create all required key-value pairs where the key contains a unique secret name (we recommend meaningful names so that the key is easy to identify) and the value contains the sensitive data. Keys and values \u200b\u200bare case-sensitive.\nAs a result, the path to the created secret is as follows: `<secretsEnginePath>/dbPostgreSql`, where `<secretsEnginePath>` is the path to the secrets engine, and dbPostgreSql is the path to the secret.\nImportant\nWhen changing secret values in Vault, restart Creatio to use the new values.\nFig. 2 An example of filled-in keys in Vault\n![Fig. 2 An example of filled-in keys in Vault](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/vault/vault_keys.png)\nThis example uses the data from the following line in the ConnectionStrings.config file:\n<add name=\"dbPostgreSql\" connectionString=\"Pooling=true; Database=SOME_DB_NAME; Host=SOME_DB_HOST; Username=SOME_USER; Password=SOME_PASSWORD; Port=SOME_DB_PORT; Timeout=5; CommandTimeout=400\" />  \nwhere:\n* DbHost is the DB server address that matches the Host parameter with the value of SOME_DB_HOST.\n* DbPort is the DB server port that matches the Port parameter with the value of SOME_DB_PORT.\n* DbName is the DB server name that matches the Database parameter with the value of SOME_DB_NAME.\n* Username is the DB username that matches the Username parameter with the value of SOME_USER.\n* Password is the DB password that matches the Password parameter with the value of SOME_PASSWORD.\nLearn more: [Versioned Key/Value Secrets Engine](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/versioned-kv) (official Vault documentation).\n### Set up the security policy\u200b\nSince Vault can store different types of sensitive information, we recommend creating separate security policies to control the access levels for the specified keys. Creatio\u2019s access privileges to the secrets engine must be read-only.\nIn the future, you can use these policies when generating authorization client tokens or when adding client certificates to Vault.\nA policy that gives Creatio read access to all secrets in the secrets engine with the `<secretsEnginePath>` path is as follows:\npath \"<secretsEnginePath>/*\" {capabilities = [\"read\", \"list\"] }  \nwhere `<secretsEnginePath>` is the path to the secrets engine.\nLearn more: [Policies](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies) (official Vault documentation).\n### Set up Vault authorization\u200b\nCreatio supports the following Vault authorization types:\n* by client certificate\n* by token.\n#### Set up certificate authorization\u200b\n1. Issue a sseparate [client certificate](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/cert) and register it on the Creatio host machine.\n2. Add the certificate to Vault as the authorization method.\n3. Specify the policy to read the secrets with the data from the connection strings.\nLearn more: [Auth Methods](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth) (official Vault documentation).\n#### Set up token authorization\u200b\nVault generates a Root Token upon initialization. We strongly advise against using that token for authorization as it grants virtually unlimited privileges. For Creatio authorization, generate a client token with security policies that would only allow to read secrets meant to substitute the templates in the connection strings of your application.\nTo generate a client token for Creation authorization in Vault, run the following command:\nvault token create -policy=<policyName>  \nwhere `<policyName>` is the name of the security policy.\nLearn more: [Tokens](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens), [Token create - Command](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/token/create) (official Vault documentation).\n## Settings on the Creatio side\u200b\n### Set up Vault connection parameters\u200b\nVault connection settings must be specified in the vaultConfig section of the **web.config** file in the Creatio root folder. The parameters of the section are described in the table below:\nParameter name| Details| Value  \n---|---|---  \nhostUri| A string with the address of the Vault server| The pattern: `https://<Vault server address>:<Vault server port>`.  \nauthMethodType| Authorization type| Acceptable values: **Token**. Authorize by token. **Cert**. Authorize by certificate.  \nsecretsEnginePath| The path to the Vault secrets engine| We recommend using your website\u2019s name as the value.  \ntoken| A string with the client token.| Specified if authorizing by token.  \ncertFilePath| Path to the certificate. Creatio version 8.0.5 Atlas and later lets you store Vault authentication certificates in Windows Certificate Store. Also, the certificate can now be read both by the name and ThumbPrint.| Specified if authorizing by certificate.  \ncertPassword| The password for the certificate.| Specified if the certificate is password-protected, blank otherwise.  \nIf an illegal value if specified as authMethodType, Creatio will throw an error.\n* Token connection example\n* Certificate connection example\n<vaultConfig hostUri=\"https://127.0.0.1:1024\" authMethodType=\"Token\" token=\"s.on3zJH6fXZlodRAYqgTXYEot\" secretsEnginePath=\"<secretsEnginePath>\" />  \n<vaultConfig hostUri=\"https://127.0.0.1:1024\" authMethodType=\"Cert\" certFilePath=\"<path>\" certPassword=\"<password>\" secretsEnginePath=\"<secretsEnginePath>\" />  \nwhere\n* `<secretsEnginePath>` is the path to the secrets engine\n* `<path>` is the path to the certificate file\n* `<password>` is the password to unlock the certificate file.\n### Set up connection string templates\u200b\nThe ConnectionStrings.config file must contain connection string templates for substitution with Vault secrets. Build templates by using the secret keys\u2019 names enclosed in **brackets** instead of the secret values.\nFor example, if a connection string has a Password=\"somePassword\" value, its template must reference it as Password=\"[DBPassword]\", where DBPassword is the secret key\u2019s name in Vault.\nIf a connection string has no secret data, leave it unchanged. In that case, the value of the string will not be substituted with its Vault counterpart.\nFor example, if the config file has the following connection string:\n<add name=\"dbPostgreSql\" connectionString=\"Pooling=true; Database=SOME_DB_NAME; Host=SOME_DB_HOST; Username=SOME_USER; Password=SOME_PASSWORD; Port=SOME_DB_PORT; Timeout=5; CommandTimeout=400\" />  \nits template may look as follows:\n<add name=\"dbPostgreSql\" connectionString=\"Pooling=true; Database=[DbName]; Host=[DbHost]; Username=[Username]; Password=[Password]; Port=[DbPort]; Timeout=5; CommandTimeout=400\" />  \nwhere DbHost, DbPort, DbName, Username, Password are the keys of the corresponding secrets stored in Vault.\n### Enable flags\u200b\nTo configure **connection strings** in the web.config file located in the Creatio root folder, add the following lines to the `<appSettings>` section:\n<add key=\"UseConnectionStringProvider\" value=\"true\" />  \n<add key=\"UseSecretsInConnectionStrings\" value=\"true\" />  \nIf you also want to use **encryption keys** (AES), take the following steps:\n1. Add the `<appSettings>:<add key=\"UseSecretsInEncryptionKeys\" value=\"true\" />` line to the section in the web.config file located in the Creatio root folder.\n2. In the Vault secrets storage whose name is specified in the configuration file in the vaultConfig section \u2192 the secretsEnginePath parameter, add a secret named EncryptionKeys.\n3. In the EncryptionKeys secret, add the keys with the values \u200b\u200bspecified in the Creatio configuration file:\n* InitializationSecurityVector,\n* CurrentSecurityKey.\n4. Remove the InitializationSecurityVector and CurrentSecurityKey attributes from the configuration file.\nFig. 3 Example of filled-in keys\n![Fig. 3 Example of filled-in keys](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/vault/aes_keys.png)\nImportant\nThe names of the secret and keys must exactly match the ones above. If the flags are disabled, Vault will not correctly store sensitive data of Creatio.\nRestart Creatio to apply the changes.\n## Disable storage of keys in Vault\u200b\nTo disable storage of AES keys in Vault, take the following steps:\n1. Add the following flags to the configuration file of Creatio:\n* InitializationSecurityVector\n* CurrentSecurityKey.\nThe values \u200b\u200bof the keys are stored in the Vault secrets engine whose name is specified in the configuration file in the vaultConfig section \u2192 the secretsEnginePath parameter \u2192 the EncryptionKeys secret:\n<add key=\"InitializationSecurityVector\" value=\"Vault_key_value\" />  \n<add key=\"CurrentSecurityKey\" value=\"Vault_key_value\" />  \n2. Disable the UseSecretsInEncryptionKeys flag in the Creatio configuration file:\n<add key=\"UseSecretsInEncryptionKeys\" value=\"false\" />  \n3. Restart Creatio to apply the changes.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Modify ConnectionStrings.config for MS SQL Server](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2138)\n[Modify ConnectionStrings.config for Oracle Database](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2139)\n[Modify ConnectionStrings.config for PostgreSQL](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2140)\n[Prepare to deploy Creatio .NET Core on Linux](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2120)",
