  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nWhen working with Creatio, you may need to view the changes made to your data and see who made these changes and when. For example, you can check which contact records were changed last month.\nThe data change history is available in the **Change log** section ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_16493_618)).\nFig. 1 The Change log section view\n![Fig.\u00a01 The Change log section view](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_crd_example.png)\nThe change log contains information about adding, modifying, and deleting records (entries) in the database tables for Creatio objects. This includes sections, details, lookups, as well as other objects.\nThere are two ways you can open a change log for viewing its records:\n* Open the **Change log** section from the System Designer and select an object to view its logs\n* Open the change log of a specific record directly from the **record page**.\n## Method 1. View the record changes from the change log\u200b\nExample\nView the contact records that were changed last month.\n1. Open the System Designer, e.g., by clicking ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/btn_system_designer.png).\n2. Under **Users and administration** , click **Change log**.\nnote\nTo view the changes, make sure you have the **Access to \"Change log\" section** (CanManageChangeLog) system operation permission.\nLearn more about using system operations in the \"[System operation permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=258)\" article.\n3. Set the filter - for our example, select \"Sections\".\n4. Find the needed object using the search bar or manually. In our example, we use the \"Contact\" object. Click the object title to open the change log page.\n5. Click the **Log data** tab and set the date filter (Fig. 1). In our example, it is the time period from February 2nd to March 2nd, 2020.\nFig. 1 Filtering changes by date for the Contact object\n![Fig.\u00a01 Filtering changes by date for the Contact object](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_wnd_filter_date.png)\nAs a result, the list of records that were changed within the specified period will be displayed (Fig. 2). The icons next to dates display the type of the performed operations: deleting, adding or editing.\nFig. 2 Viewing the change log\n![Fig.\u00a02 Viewing the change log](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_crd_view_section.png)\n6. Use the **search bar** to quickly find the needed record by title. In our case - by the contact\u2019s full name (Fig. 3). To learn the details of the performed changes, click the name in the **Record** column.\nFig. 3 Quick search by record name\n![Fig.\u00a03 Quick search by record name](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_crd_find.png)\n## Method 2. View logs of a specific record directly from the record page\u200b\nExample\nSee the change log of the field values on the page of a specific contact for the last month.\n1. Open the page of the needed record.\n2. Click **Actions** \u2192 **View change log** (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 The View change log action\n![Fig.\u00a01 The View change log action](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_crd_view_record.png)\nnote\nIf you cannot see the **View change log** command in the **Actions** menu, make sure you have permission to the **View change log** (CanViewChangeLog) system operation.\nLearn more about using system operations in the \"[System operation permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=258)\" article.\n3. The page that opens will display information about the selected record:\n1. dates of the changes\n2. authors of the changes\n3. record name\n4. list of the changed columns\n5. values before the change\n6. values after the change\n4. Set the date filter to display only the changes for the last month. (Fig. 2). In our example, it is the time period from February 2nd to March 2nd, 2020.\nFig. 2 Filtering changes by date for the log of a specific record\n![Fig.\u00a02 Filtering changes by date for the log of a specific record](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_wnd_contact_filter_date.png)\nAs a result, you will see the changes that were made in the logged fields within the specified period (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Record logs\n![Fig.\u00a03 Record logs](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_change_log/scr_section_change_log_view_column_record.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Clear the change log](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1455)",
