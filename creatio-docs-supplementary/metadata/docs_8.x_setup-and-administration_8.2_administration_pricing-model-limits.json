  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nCreatio pricing model lets you select one of multiple subscription plans: Growth, Enterprise, or Unlimited. These plans provide different levels of functionality and resources. You can view the full list of levels in the current price list here: [Creatio pricing](https://www.creatio.com/products/pricing).\nThe subscription plans offer tiered access to features and resources, designed to accommodate varying business needs. Specifically, the plans provide the following:\n* **Features**. For example, the ability to use single sign-on. Only Enterprise and Unlimited customers can use it.\n* **Resources**. These are mostly connected to server capabilities. For example, drive space usage and the number of executed business process elements.\nThe cap on resources is soft. This means when you reach it, Creatio does not block anything immediately. Instead, we talk to you about changing the subscription plan or purchasing an addon, such as additional drive space.\nYou can monitor server resource consumption in the **Subscriptions** section of the Application Hub. The feature is available for beta testing. To gain access to the section, contact Creatio support. If you have any feedback, contact us at: [beta@creatio.com](mailto:beta@creatio.com). All feedback is appreciated.\nFig. 1 Viewing resource consumption details\n![Fig.\u00a01 Viewing resource consumption details](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/pricing_model_limits/gif_subscription_details.gif)\nAll services you can use as part of your Creatio experience can be divided into the following groups:\n* **Account level services**. These are not limited on the level of a specific environment and are applied to your entire organization. For example, data stored for every separate environment can have varied size, but total size of data stored for all environments has a cap.\n* **Environment level services**. These are applied to every specific environment. For example, if you have Growth subscription plan and **alphabusiness** and **pre-alphabusiness** websites, you can execute up to 50000 process elements per month for each environment.\n## Resource management\u200b\n#### Total Database storage size\u200b\nAccount level service. Covers records that are displayed in all out-of-the-box and custom Creatio sections, lookup records, logs of executed business processes, etc. Comprises total size of your environment databases. This includes both data and indexes. Excludes the technical space that the database reserves and some specific Creatio technical tables. Measured in megabytes.\nThe cap depends on the following parameters:\n* subscription plan\n* number of active full user licenses\n* purchased add-ons\nFor example, you have 30 Studio Growth licenses and no add-ons. In this case, the available data storage size is 1 Gb * 30 licenses = 30 Gb total.\nAlternatively, you have 50 Studio Enterprise license and an add-on for 40 Gbs. In this case, the available data storage size is 2 Gb * 50 licenses + 40 from add-ons = 140 Gbs total.\nThe cap is not bound to data of any specific user but rather to the total size of your data storage. One user can create data that takes up 3 Gb and another one data that takes up 15 Mb.\n#### Total attachment storage size\u200b\nAccount level service. Covers files that are attached to records in both out-of-the-box and custom Creatio sections. Comprises total size of all files that are stored in external file storage, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob, in Creatio Cloud for all your environments. Measured in megabytes\nIf you store your files in database instead of external file storage, the attachment file storage usage is 0, and data storage consumption is higher because files are taken into account during data storage size calculation.\nThe cap depends on the following parameters:\n* subscription plan\n* number of active full user licenses\n* purchased add-ons\nFor example, you have 30 Studio Growth licenses and no add-ons. In this case, the available attachment storage size is 1 Gb * 30 licenses = 30 Gb total.\nAlternatively, you have 50 Studio Enterprise licenses and an add-on for 40 Gbs.In this case, the available data storage size is 2 Gb * 50 licenses + 40 from add-ons = 140 Gbs total.\nThe cap is not bound to data of any specific user but rather to the total size of your data storage. One user can create data that takes up 3 Gb and another one data that takes up 15 Mb.\n#### Number of environments\u200b\nAccount level service. Comprises the number of your environments in Creatio Cloud. Takes into account only environments that have production, pre-production, and development types.\nThe cap depends on the pricing plan.\n#### Monthly business process executed\u200b\nEnvironment level service. Comprises the number of custom business process elements that were executed. Custom means business processes that were created by you from scratch or a new version of an out-of-the-box process that you created. Out-of-the-box business processes that were not replaced using a custom new version are not taken into account. Includes processes launched by all internal and external users.\nUsage refresh term is 1 month. The number is reset to 0 every first day of the month.\nThe cap is applied only to customers that have Growth plan and has fixed value of 50000 executed elements.\nThe service has no add-ons. If you want to use more elements, upgrade your subscription plan.\n#### Daily OData REST API calls\u200b\nEnvironment level service. Comprises the number of API requests made to both OData 4 and 3, i.e., \"/OData\" or \"/EntityDataService.\" For batch queries, every operation inside the batch body is calculated as a separate request.\nUsage refresh term is 1 day. The number is reset to zero every day at 0:00 AM UTC.\nThe cap is applied only to customers that have Growth plan and depends on the number of full user licenses. One full user license provides you with 10000 API calls.\nFor example, you have 50 Studio Growth licenses. In this case, the number of available daily OData API calls is 50 * 10 000 = 500000 total.\nThe service has no add-ons. If you want to use more calls, upgrade your subscription plan.\nThe cap is not applied to specific users. Any user can make any number of API calls.\n#### Daily webhook service calls\u200b\nEnvironment level service. Comprises the number of API requests made to the Creatio webhook service.\nUsage refresh term is 1 day. The number is reset to zero every day at 0:00 AM UTC.\nThe cap is applied only to customers that have Growth plan and depends on the number of full user licenses. One full user license provides you with 10000 calls.\nFor example, you have 50 Studio Growth licenses. In this case, the number of available daily webhook service calls is 50 * 10 000 = 500000 total.\nThe service has no add-ons. If you want to use more calls, upgrade your subscription plan.\nThe cap is not applied to specific users. Any user can make any number of calls.\n#### Daily custom web service calls\u200b\nEnvironment level service. Comprises the number of API requests made to custom web services developed by you using C# code. Both authorized and anonymous web services are taken into account.\nUsage refresh term is 1 day. The number is reset to zero every day at 0:00 AM UTC.\nThe cap is applied only to customers that have Growth plan and depends on the number of full user licenses. One full user license provides you with 10000 calls.\nFor example, you have 50 Studio Growth licenses. In this case, the number of available daily custom web service calls is 50 * 10 000 = 500000 total.\nThe service has no add-ons. If you want to use more calls, upgrade your subscription plan.\nThe cap is not applied to specific users. Any user can make any number of calls.\n#### Number of functional and organizational roles\u200b\nEnvironment level service. Comprises functional and organizational roles that are included in both **All employees** and **All external users** branches. The following roles are excluded from the calculation:\n**Functional roles** :\n* Studio\n* Administrator\n* Developer\n* All employees\n* All external users\n* Administrator for the organization on the portal\n**Organizational roles** :\n* System administrator\n* All employees\n* All external users\nThe cap is applied only to customers that have Growth plan and has a fixed value of 50 organizational and functional roles.\nThe service has no add-ons. If you want to use more roles, upgrade your subscription plan.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio licensing](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1264)\n[Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1472)",
