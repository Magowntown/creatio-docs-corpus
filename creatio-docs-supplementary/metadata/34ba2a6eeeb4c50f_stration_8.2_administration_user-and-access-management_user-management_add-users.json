Click ![btn_com_lookup.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_com_lookup.png) in the **Contact** field, then click **New** in the lookup box that pops up. Fill out the contact page that opens. After you save the contact page, you will return to the new user page, with the **Contact** field populated with the newly created contact.\n### Create a user\u200b\n1.

Available values are \"External user\" or \"Company employee\".  \nActive| A status checkbox selected automatically for active users. Clear the checkbox to deactivate a user.  \nCulture| The UI language for the current user. Creatio populates the value automatically, the user can change the UI language in the user profile. The field displays active languages. To select other languages, activate them in the **Languages** section of the System Designer. Learn more about Creatio cultures: [Manage UI languages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1624).  \nHome page| Select a section page that will open by default when the user logs in to Creatio. If you leave the field empty, the user will be redirected to the Main Menu, and upon subsequent logins \u2013 to the last opened page during the previous session.  \nDate and time format| Specify the format that will be used to display dates for the user. You can leave the field empty, the user will be able to specify the format later in the user profile.  \n4. **Fill out the Authentication detail** :\nField| Field value  \n---|---  \nUsername| Enter the Creatio user login. This is a required field.  \nEmail| Enter the Creatio user login email. If you fill out this field, the user will be able to log in with either the username or the email.  \nPassword, Password confirmation| Enter the password the user will use to log in to Creatio. These are required fields.  \nPassword expiration date| The field is non-editable and displays the date when the password expires. The date is calculated based on the **Default value** field of the \"Password validity term, days\" (\"MaxPasswordAge\" code) system setting. The value is set to \"0\" out of the box, in which case the password has no expiration date, and the **Password expiration date** field on the user page remains blank and locked.  \nReset password| Select this checkbox if you want to force the user to change their password when logging in for the next time. If the checkbox is selected on the user page, Creatio will notify the user that their password has expired and request changing it at the next login attempt.  \nnote\nIf you use the LDAP authentication, select the **LDAP authentication** checkbox and specify the username from the LDAP lookup in the **Username** field. The lookup in this field contains the list of LDAP users that have not been synchronized with Creatio yet. Learn more: [Set up LDAP synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=513).\n5. **Save the page**.\n**As a result** , a new user for a company employee will be added to Creatio.\n## Add a system administrator user\u200b\nOut-of-the-box Creatio has a \"System administrators\" organizational role whose members have full access to all data in Creatio. This is achieved through access to the following system operations:\n* \"Add any data\" (\"CanInsertEverything\" code)\n* \"Delete any data\" (\"CanDeleteEverything\" code)\n* \"Edit any data\" (\"CanUpdateEverything\" code)\n* \"View any data\" (\"CanSelectEverything\" code)\nLearn more: [Description of system settings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1259).\nTo **add a new system administrator user** in Creatio:\n1. **Create a contact** for the new user or make sure that the relevant contact already exists in the **Contacts** section. Learn more: Add a new contact.\n2. **Create a new user** in the **System users** section and specify the contact in the user profile. Learn more: Create a user.\n3. **Add the user to the \"System administrators\" role**.\nImportant\nAccess to these operations overrides any object permissions a user might have. For example, a user that has permission to the \"View any data\" system operation can view all records in objects, even if you try to deny the \"Read\" permission for that user in the object permission UI.\nYou can assign the system administrator role to a user in multiple ways:\n* from the user page\n* from the role page\n### Method 1. Assign a system administrator role to a user from the user\u2019s page\u200b\n1.

Assign a system administrator role to a user from the role page\u200b\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/academy_en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/add_users/8_1/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) \u2192 **Organizational roles**.\n2. **Select the \"System administrators\" role** in the list of organizational roles represented in the form of a folder tree. The area to the right of the roles tree will show the page of the selected role.\n3. On the **Users** tab:\n1. Click ![btn_com_add_tab00003.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_com_add_tab00003.png) and select **Add existing** to **add an existing user**.
