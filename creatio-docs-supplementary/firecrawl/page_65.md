Out of the box, mobile app enables external users to create cases quickly and send messages to support agents on the go using the **Cases** section. The app sends push notifications when the case status changes. You can use the app even if you have no internet access. After the connection is restored, the app uploads the changes to Creatio.

## Create a new case [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/mobile/basics/use-the-portal-in-the-mobile-app\#title-2292-1 "Direct link to Create a new case")

2. Fill out the case profile:
1. Select the case category to accelerate case classification and transfer cases to dedicated experts faster: “ [Service request](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/glossary_page#title-2071-146)” or “ [Incident](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/glossary_page#title-2071-70).” The field is required.

2. Elaborate on the case in the **Description** field (optional).

      - Select the relevant files. Out of the box, you can upload files up to 10 Mb. The administrator of the main Creatio application can change the maximum attachment file size. On the **Attachments** tab of the case record, you can view any attachments added when creating the case or as part of a conversation with support agent.
3. Tap the ![btn_approve.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/mobile_portal/8_1/btn_approve.png) button.

note

We recommend filling out the **Description** field when you create a case to ensure support agents receive the information required to solve the case. If you leave the **Description** field empty when you create a case, Creatio will populate the field with the value of the **Category** field.

## Search for a case [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/mobile/basics/use-the-portal-in-the-mobile-app\#title-2292-3 "Direct link to Search for a case")

You can search for a case by description or number in the case list. To search for cases:

1. Tap the ![btn_search.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/mobile_portal/8_1/btn_search.png) button at the top of the screen. This opens the search bar.
2. Enter a part of the case number or description in the search bar.
3. The app displays the index of cases that match the search criteria. If the app finds no such cases, it displays the “No data” message.
