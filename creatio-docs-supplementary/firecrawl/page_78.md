**Household management**. You can now group multiple contacts into a single household unit based on family or shared living arrangements. The new **Households** section provides centralized access to household data, improving visibility across customer relationships and enabling more personalized financial services.

**Underwriting**. You can now perform underwriting with greater visibility, automation, and control by using underwriting evaluations in application processing. This includes dedicated underwriting workspace, credit report management, and automatic and manual underwriting checks. This release also includes a new **Underwriting rules** section for configuration.

**Customer life events**. It is now possible to capture customer life events, for example, marriage, divorce, or educational milestones, directly in the contact profile. This lets you maintain accurate customer records and make better-informed decisions. Selected events might trigger Creatio.ai to generate insights or alerts, enabling timely actions such as risk identification or personalized service recommendations.

**Loan management**. It is now possible to manage loans with full visibility and control using the overhauled **Loans** section. It now supports common loan types including unsecured personal loans, credit cards, lines of credit, and auto loans, with dedicated field sets and dynamic form behavior. You can view repayment terms, track installment schedules, monitor credit limit changes, and manage linked cards and applications within a structured, product-specific interface.

**Card management**. It is now possible to manage retail card products in a structured way using the overhauled **Cards** section. It includes product-specific form behavior for debit and credit cards. For debit cards, you can manage account-linked limits and balances while credit cards display loan data, rewards, and available credit information. The UI also supports linked bank accounts, transactions, and related cards.

**Bank account management**. You can now manage retail banking products accurately and efficiently using the overhauled **Bank accounts** section. It provides dedicated form layouts for supported account types. For certificates of deposit, checking, savings and money market accounts, the form now displays product-specific fields, for example, interest rates, term lengths, overdraft settings, and debit card options. You can also view linked cards and transaction histories within each account record.

- Automated evaluation expiry. Evaluations are now deactivated automatically upon reaching their due date, with corresponding updates to the contact's verification status.
- Evaluation reuse across applications. Existing active KYC evaluations are reused in new applications automatically to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.

**Loan service processes**. You can now manage existing credit products more efficiently using the new "Launch credit card limit change," "Credit card loan closure," and "Line of credit loan closure" business processes.

**Credit application processes**. You can now manage retail credit products quickly and easily using the new "Auto loans," "Credit cards," "Lines of credit," "Unsecured personal loans" loan types. Each type includes all essential stages to support end-to-end credit onboarding.
