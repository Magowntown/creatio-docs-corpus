| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contact management | Contact page | Changed | Added support for color coding in customer life event categories to improve visual recognition and streamline interaction with the event-related data. This change improves data visibility, supports faster decision-making, and enhances the overall user experience when working with life events.<br>More details<br>Added the "Color" (`Color` code) column to the "Customer life event category" (`CustomerLifeEventCategory` code) object. This change affects existing contacts of the "Customer" type and is applied to the "Category" column in the **Life events** expanded list on the **Contact info** tab of the contact page after upgrading the app to version 1.2. |
| Contact management | Contact page | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the **AI insights and alerts** expanded list on the **Overview** tab of the contact page displayed records unrelated to the current contact.<br>More details<br>- Changed the `VwAIInsightsAndAlerts_Top5RecordsMsSql`, `VwAIInsightsAndAlerts_Top5RecordsOracle`, `VwAIInsightsAndAlerts_Top5RecordsPostgreSql` SQL scripts to return the latest five AI insights and alerts per contact.<br>  <br>- Renamed the system-facing objects for improved UI clarity:<br>  - "VwAIInsightsAndAlerts" to "AI insights and alerts view (view)" for the `VwAIInsightsAndAlerts` object.<br>  - "AIinsightsAndAlerts\_BatchTempTable" to "AI insights and alerts batch temp table" for the `AIinsightsAndAlerts_BatchTempTable` object.<br>- Removed:<br>  - Unrelated "AI Insight" (`AIInsight` code) object from the **AI insights and alerts** expanded list on the **Overview** tab of the contact page in the Freedom UI Designer.<br>  - "Contact in household AI insights and alerts (view)" (`VwCIH_AIInsightsAndAlerts` code) object from the **AI insights and alerts** expanded list on the **Overview** tab of the contact page in the Freedom UI Designer to eliminate unused and redundant data sources and improve maintainability.<br>  - Filtering by period from the **AI insights and alerts** expanded list on the **Overview** tab of the contact page, as the list displays only the latest five records, making date-based filtering irrelevant and potentially misleading. |
| Contact management | Contact incomes,<br>Contact expenses,<br>Contact liabilities | Changed | Modified the list of actions in the **Income**, **Expenses**, and **Liabilities** expanded lists on the **Financial summary** tab of the contact page to better align with supported financial data management workflows.<br>More details<br>Removed the **Copy** action from the list of row actions to prevent unintended data duplication and ensure better data consistency. |
| Contact management | Customer identification | Changed | Added the **City** and **ZIP/postal code** fields to the **Communication options** expanded list on the contact profile of the customer identification page to support more complete address data capture during onboarding and compliance processes. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Added household history tracking to improve the traceability of key household data changes over time.<br>More details<br>Added:<br>- "Household history" (`HouseholdHistory` code) object that includes the "Household" (`Household` code), "Full address" (`FullAddress` code), and "Primary contact" (`PrimaryContact` code) columns.<br>- **History** tab on the household page. The tab includes the **Household history** expanded list filtered by the current household.<br>- "Create household history" business process that logs history records automatically when the **Primary contact** or **Address info** profiles on the household page change. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Added automated control mechanisms to ensure that every household has an assigned primary contact.<br>More details<br>Added:<br>- "Manage household without primary contact" business process that triggers when a household is created without a primary contact or when the existing primary contact is unassigned.<br>- "Assign primary contact in household (sub-process)" business process that populates the **Primary contact** profile on the household page.<br>- Automatic task completion once a new primary contact is assigned successfully. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Added support for creating a household member directly from the contact page. This change improves the household member management experience, reduces unnecessary manual steps, prevents accidental edits, and streamlines the creation of related records through direct actions.<br>More details<br>- Added:<br>  - **Contact** page parameter to the "Create contact in household mini page" (`ContactInHousehold_MiniPage` code) schema.<br>  - "Make elements read-only, editable: Contact, Household" page-level business rule to the "Create contact in household mini page" (`ContactInHousehold_MiniPage` code) schema. The rule makes the "Contact" column read-only and the "Household" column editable when the **Contact** page parameter is populated.<br>  - `crt.HandleViewModelAttributeChangeRequest` request handler to the "Create contact in household mini page" (`ContactInHousehold_MiniPage` code) schema. The handler tracks changes in the `PageParameters_Contact` attribute and sets its value to the "Contact" (`Contact` code) column of the "Contact in household" (`ContactInHousehold` code) object, enabling business rules to react to page parameters and adjust field accessibility based on the entry point.<br>  - **New** button to the **Households** expanded list on the **Contact info** tab of the contact page. The button opens the "Create household mini page" (`CreateHousehold_MiniPage`) schema.<br>- Changed the **Household** field on the **Legal & identification** profile of the contact page to read-only. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Changed the quick filter in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page to more accurately represent the current household members. This change improves clarity for users reviewing household composition and supports more accurate and consistent record tracking.<br>More details<br>- Renamed the quick filter in the **Members** expanded list from "Active" to "Current member."<br>- Changed the filter logic so that it includes contacts whose "Status" column value in the **Members** expanded list is "Active" or "Opted out," ensuring all current members are displayed under the same filter. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Modified the list of actions in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page to comply with supported household management workflows. This change helps maintain data accuracy and ensures users operate only within valid household management actions, avoiding unintended operations.<br>More details<br>Removed:<br>- **Merge** action from the list of bulk actions to prevent unsupported merge scenarios.<br>- **Copy** action from the list of row actions to avoid unintended duplication of household members. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Improved the household creation flow. This change ensures that each household is consistently created with valid primary contact data, avoids conflicts with duplicate primary contact assignments, and streamlines ownership tracking for better accuracy.<br>More details<br>- Added support for defining default role values for primary contacts. The functionality is managed by the new "Default primary contact role in household" (`DefaultPrimaryContactRoleInHousehold`) system setting. Out of the box, the default value is "Head."<br>  <br>- Changed:<br>  - "Create household mini page" (`CreateHousehold_MiniPage`) schema:<br>    - Added the **Primary contact** field.<br>    - Removed the **Continue in other page** button.<br>  - "Check primary contact in other households" business process to trigger when the **Primary contact** field on the **Create household mini page** in the **Households** section or on the **Create contact in household mini page** of the household page is populated, ensuring the selected contact is not already a primary contact in another household.<br>    <br>  - Logic for populating the **Owner** field in the **Household info** profile on the household page. Now, the current contact is automatically set as the owner for newly created households.<br>    <br>  - The **List** component of the **Households list page** to disable inline editing to prevent direct edits.<br>    <br>  - The **Full name** field on the **Primary contact** profile of the household page to read-only.<br>    <br>  - "Create contact in household" business process to automatically populate the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page when a primary contact is defined during household creation. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Improved the management of household members to ensure data integrity and consistent application of household membership rules across all member statuses.<br>More details<br>- Added:<br>  - "Contact in household edit mini page" (`ContactInHouseholdEdit_MiniPage` code) client module that implements the mini page.<br>  - `"readonly": true` property to the source code for the "Contact" (`ContactInHouseholdGridDetailDS_Contact` code) column in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page. This prevents changes once a contact is added.<br>  - "Deactivate contact in household" business process that handles status changes to "Archived," "Moved out," or "Opted out" in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page.<br>  - "Remove contact in household" business process that handles deletion of members whose status is "Active" or "Opted out" in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page.<br>- Changed:<br>  - The **Required** property value in the **General** property block of Object Designer from "No" to "Yes" for the "Status" (`ContactInHouseholdStatus` code) column in the "Contact in household" (`ContactInHousehold` code) object.<br>  - "Manage household primary contact assignment" business process to trigger on status changes, ensuring that the household primary contact remains up to date. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Changed the contact selection logic on the "Create contact in household mini page" (`ContactInHousehold_MiniPage` code) schema to prevent adding the same active contact to a household more than once. This change improves data consistency and eliminates duplication in household composition by enforcing selection rules.<br>More details<br>Added a filter to the **Contact** field on the "Create contact in household mini page" (`ContactInHousehold_MiniPage` code) schema to exclude contacts already associated with the current household. The filter is applied for both "Selection window" and "Dropdown list" values of the **Lookup view** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of how the user selects a contact. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Added a unified timeline for displaying AI insights and alerts related to household members, centralizing key information for improved usability and decision-making. This change shifts the focus from individual contacts to household members, providing users with a clearer overview of key alerts in one place and enhancing visibility.<br>More details<br>Added:<br>- "Contact in household AI insights and alerts (view)" (`VwCIH_AIInsightsAndAlerts`) object that includes the "Contact" (`Contact` code), "Description" (`Description` code), "Household" (`Household` code), and "Name" (`Name` code) columns.<br>- "Contact in household AI insights and alerts (view)" object to the **AI insights and alerts** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page in the Freedom UI Designer. The new object displays the top five AI insights and alert events for each household member whose status in the **Members** expanded list is "Active" or "Opted out."<br>- `IX_ContactInHousehold_Contact_Status` index to the "Contact in household" (`ContactInHousehold` code) object to improve query performance. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Added support for validating duplicate household membership and automating primary contact reassignment to improve accuracy and reduce manual intervention in household member management and ensure consistent updates.<br>More details<br>Added:<br>- A validation check to the "Create contact in household mini page" (`ContactInHousehold_MiniPage` code) schema that triggers the "Check primary contact in other households" business process. Creatio notifies users when the selected contact is already a member of another household.<br>- A new reassignment flow to the "Manage household primary contact assignment" business process. If a contact whose **Primary contact** checkbox is selected in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page is unassigned and only one active member remains in the previous household, that remaining member is assigned as the new primary contact automatically. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Changed address field accessibility on the household page to prevent manual edits and ensure alignment with automated address synchronization workflows and maintain consistent field behavior.<br>More details<br>- Added the "Make elements read-only: Address fields" object-level business rule to the "Households form page" (`Households_FormPage` code) schema. The rule makes all address-related fields read-only on the household page.<br>- Changed the **Country**, **State/province**, and **City** fields on the **Address info** profile of the household page to no longer display values as links to prevent navigation from these fields. |
| Contact management | Households section | Changed | Changed the household address synchronization logic to ensure the household address always reflects the latest primary address of the designated primary contact. This change improves data consistency, prevents duplicate addresses, and reduces manual updates across all synchronization scenarios.<br>More details<br>Changed the "Update address in household" business process to run automatically when the **Primary** checkbox is selected for an existing address in the **Addresses** expanded list on the **Contact info** tab of the contact page for a contact whose "Status" column is set to "Active" and **Primary contact** checkbox is selected in the **Members** expanded list on the **General information** tab of the household page, or when a new primary address is added for such a contact. The process replaces the household address only when the contact meets the required conditions and ensures that no duplicate addresses are created during synchronization. |
| Financial documents | Document management | Changed | Renamed the "Unuploaded" status to "Not uploaded" in the **Document statuses** lookup to improve clarity and align with standard terminology. This change replaces the previous non-standard status label with a consistent terminology update. |
| Applications and credit processing | Evaluation management | Changed | Changed evaluation status handling to improve evaluation tracking and UI clarity. This change ensures that evaluation statuses clearly reflect each stage of automated and manual processing while keeping the status log up to date in real time.<br>More details<br>- Added:<br>  - "Manual selection enabled" (`ManualSelectionEnabled` code) column of the "Boolean" type to the "Evaluation status" (`EvaluationStatus` code) object to control whether a status can be selected manually in the UI. The column is available out of the box in the **Evaluation statuses** lookup and contains the "Yes" value for statuses where manual selection is applicable.<br>  - "Apply static filter: Status" object-level business rule to the "Evaluation history" (`EvaluationHistory` code) object. The rule displays only those values in the **Status** field on the **General information** tab of the **Evaluation history mini page** whose "Manual selection enabled" column in the **Evaluation statuses** lookup is set to "Yes."<br>  - "Auto checks processing," "Auto checks completed," "Auto checks declined," and "Cancelled" statuses to the **Evaluation statuses** lookup to support automated flow tracking.<br>- Changed the status of the **Enable live data update** checkbox in the **Behavior** property block of the Object Designer for the "Evaluation status log" (`EvaluationStatusLog` code) object from cleared to selected, enabling real-time UI updates. |
| Applications and credit processing | Evaluation management | Changed | Changed the evaluation history flow in the underwriting process to clearly distinguish checks that become irrelevant after a negative approval outcome and reduce ambiguity in status interpretation.<br>More details<br>Added the "Cancelled" status to the **Evaluation check statuses** lookup. Previously, checks that became irrelevant due to early rejection in underwriting could only be marked as "Rejected," which caused confusion and did not reflect the actual process outcome. This change affects existing contacts and is applied to the "Status" column in the **Evaluation history** expanded list on the **Compliance & risk monitoring** tab of the contact page after upgrading the app to version 1.2. |
| Apps and packages | Package management | Changed | Changed the placement of the "Evaluation history (Page settings)" (`EvaluationHistoryRelatedPage` code) schema of the "Add-on" type from the `CrtFinservCstmr360ObjMdl` package to the `CrtFinservCstmr360` package, where the related "Evaluation history mini page" (`EvaluationHistory_MiniPage` code) schema is defined. This change eliminates circular dependencies between packages and improves maintainability by aligning the add-on with its corresponding UI component. |
| Schema management | Schema inheritance | Changed | Changed the implementation of the "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas to separate application-specific versioning logic from the standard save behavior. This change improves separation of concerns between general contact data management and application-specific versioning logic, ensuring consistent behavior in financial applications while keeping **Customer 360** app functionality unchanged.<br>More details<br>- Added replaced schemas for the "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas to the `CrtFinservAppMgmt` package. These replaced schemas implement versioning-related functionality to ensure that versioning is applied only in the application context.<br>- Changed the corresponding "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas in the `CrtFinservCstmr360` package so that the **Save** button uses only the default save logic. |

## Finserv Account Management [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/finserv-changelog/1-2-finserv-changelog\#title-finserv-account-management "Direct link to Finserv Account Management")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Banking and financial products | Card management | Fixed | Fixed the issue with incorrect card number formatting and expiration field usage in the card creation flow across loan and bank account workflows. This change improves data consistency and clarity when generating cards through integrated processes.<br>More details<br>Changed:<br>- "Bank Core API - Create new loan" business process. The process returns full unmasked loan numbers.<br>- "Bank Core API - Create new bank account" business process. The process returns full unmasked account numbers.<br>- "BankCoreMock\_GenerateBankNumber" (`BankCoreMock_GenerateBankNumber` code) user task. The user task returns full unmasked card numbers.<br>- "Loan: create new record" and "Bank account: create new record" business processes. The processes apply card number masking through the "Mask card number (sub-process)" business process using the format "\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* 1111."<br>- Logic for setting expiration information on the **General information** tab of the card page. The **Expiration date** field is now populated during creation, while the **End date** field continues to store the actual card termination date. |
| Banking and financial products | Card page | Changed | Changed the card page to improve usability and provide clearer and more relevant card information.<br>More details<br>- Added replaced schema for the "Card list page" (`Card_ListPage` code) schema to the `CrtFinservAccMgmt` package. The replaced schema manages cards.<br>  <br>- Changed:<br>  - **Title** property value in the **General** property block of Object Designer from the "Expiration Date" to "Expiration date (text)" for the `ValidDate` column in the "Card" (`BankCard` code) object.<br>    <br>  - **Cards** section list:<br>    - Added the "Product," "Payment system," and "Currency" columns.<br>    - Removed "Branch" and "End date" columns.<br>    - Aligned column widths for a consistent layout. |

## Finserv Application Management [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/finserv-changelog/1-2-finserv-changelog\#title-finserv-application-management "Direct link to Finserv Application Management")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contact management | Contact page | Changed | Added a mechanism to prevent automatic navigation to the contact page when starting or continuing a consultation, keeping users on the current screen until customer identification is completed. This change improves compliance and user experience in financial services contexts.<br>More details<br>- Added the "Override consultation start for existing customer" business process to control navigation behavior during consultation start and continuation.<br>- Changed the default value of the "Start consultation business process" (`StartConsultationProcess` code) system setting from empty to "Override consultation start for existing customer," ensuring that the override logic is applied consistently. |
| Contact management | Contact page | Changed | Improved customer classification logic by automatically populating the **Type** field on the **Contact info** profile of the contact page with the "Customer" value when an application reaches the "Settled" stage and the contact type is not yet defined.<br>More details<br>Changed:<br>- "Complete application for simple retail credit product" business process:<br>  - Added a **Contact** process parameter.<br>  - Added a **Modify data** element named "Set contact type to Customer." The element populates the **Type** field on the **Contact info** profile of the contact page with the "Customer" value when the application is in the "Settled" stage and the **Type** field is empty.<br>- "Complete application for deposit account" business process to add the **Modify data** element named "Set contact type to Customer." The element populates the **Type** field on the **Contact info** profile of the contact page with the "Customer" value when the application is in the "Settled" stage and the **Type** field is empty.<br>  <br>- "Personal loan application" (`Application_PersonalLoan` code), "Auto & home loan application" (`Application_AutoAndHomeLoan` code), and "Credit card & line of credit application" (`Application_CreditCardAndLineOfCredit` code) schemas of "Case" type to add a **Contact** process parameter that has the "\[#Main record.Contact\]" value for the "Settled" stage. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application management | Changed | Changed the post-approval verification logic to automatically verify self-reported financial data records when manual checks on the **Manual checks** expanded list on the **Underwriting** tab of the application full page are completed and the **Current status** field is set to "Approved" during the "Underwriting" stage. This change improves data consistency across related tabs and reduces the need for manual follow-up actions.<br>More details<br>Changed the "Verify financial records based on manual financial capacity check" business process to include financial data records whose "Verification status" is "Self-reported." In this case, Creatio automatically updates the "Verification status" of all linked financial data records displayed on the **Manual checks** expanded list on the **Underwriting** tab of the application full page to "Verified" and sets the "Verification performed" column on the **Income**, **Expenses**, and **Liabilities** expanded lists on the **Financial details** tab of the application full page to "Verified." In addition, Creatio sets the "Status" column on the **Identity documents** expanded list on the **Customer details** tab of the application submission page to "Verified." |
| Applications and credit processing | Application management | Changed | Improved application creation logic by dynamically initializing application status and stage based on the selected product category, reducing reliance on static configuration, and ensuring consistent stage assignment across product types.<br>More details<br>- Changed:<br>  - "Read application status and stage by product category" business process to return the application stage together with the application status.<br>  - "Create application for product type" and "Create application for selected product" business processes to set both application status and stage dynamically using the **Application stages transition map** lookup values.<br>  - "Application mini page" (`FinApplication_MiniPage` code) schema to set the **Stage** field value based on the output of the "Read application status and stage by product category" business process during application creation.<br>- Deactivated the "Set values: Stage" application-level business rule in the "Application mini page" (`FinApplication_MiniPage` code) schema to eliminate static stage assignment logic. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application page | Changed | Changed the filtering logic of the **Evaluation history** expanded list on the **Evaluation history** tab of the application full page to display only records related to the current application. Previously, the list displayed all evaluation records associated with the contact, regardless of the application context. The updated filter now uses the "Evaluation application history" (`EvaluationFinApplicationHistory` code) object to retrieve only application-specific records and ensure contextual consistency. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application management | Changed | Changed the underwriting flow for lending applications to separate automated and manual processing, ensure consistent evaluation status tracking, and streamline approval generation across all underwriting scenarios.<br>More details<br>- Changed:<br>  - "Initiate underwriting for application" business process to simplify and modularize the logic.<br>    - Merged the "Generate manual checks from underwriting rules" and "Generate mock automated underwriting checks" subprocesses into the "Generate underwriting evaluation for application" subprocess.<br>    - Separated approval generation logic into a new "Generate approval for underwriting evaluation" subprocess. This subprocess is triggered at the start of the "Initiate underwriting for application" business process instead of after manual checks completion and always creates an approval. If manual input is required, the approval is assigned to a user that has the "Underwriters" organizational role. Otherwise, the approval is automatically completed under the Creatio System Underwriter contact.<br>  - "Generate mock automated underwriting checks" business process to set the **Evaluation status** field on the application full page to "Auto checks processing" at the beginning of execution and to "Auto checks completed" at the end of execution.<br>    <br>  - "Generate manual checks from underwriting rules" business process to add logic that creates records in the **Manual checks** expanded list on the **Underwriting** tab of the application full page only for records from the **Automated checks** expanded list whose "Requires manual override" column is set to "true."<br>    <br>  - "Create manual check on required override" business process to run only when the **Automated checks** expanded list on the **Underwriting** tab of the application full page contains records whose "Requires manual override" column is set to "true."<br>- Deactivated the "Update underwriting evaluation status after manual checks completed" business process. Its logic was migrated to the "Generate manual checks from underwriting rules" business process. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application management | Changed | Changed the underwriting cancellation logic to automatically cancel all related evaluations and approvals when an application is declined during the "Underwriting" stage. This ensures data consistency, prevents incomplete underwriting tasks from remaining open, and reflects the correct application state.<br>More details<br>Changed:<br>- "Initiate underwriting for application" business process to set the **Evaluation status** field on the application full page to "Cancelled" for all open evaluation checks when an application stage is "Declined."<br>- "Application closing" business process to set the **Status** field to "Cancelled" for application-related checks in the **Evaluation history** and **Approvals** expanded lists on the **Evaluation history** tab of the application full page. When an application is manually declined on the application full page, all active evaluations, checks, and approvals are cancelled automatically. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application page | Changed | Improved the behavior of the **Disbursement** profile on the application full page to better reflect product-specific logic and prevent unintended data changes. This change ensures that users interact only with relevant financial fields based on product type and prevents manual modifications to calculated or system-driven values.<br>More details<br>- Added the "Show and hide elements: Credit cards and lines of credit product category" page-level business rule to the "Application full page" (`FinApplication_FullPage` code) schema. The rule shows the **Loan credit limit** field instead of **Loan amount** when the **Product category** is "Credit cards & lines of credit."<br>- Changed the **Loan** field on the **Disbursement** profile of the application full page to read-only. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application page | Changed | Improved the handling of financial data types on mini pages to prevent duplicate type assignment and protect data integrity across application and contact contexts.<br>More details<br>Changed:<br>- Filtering of the **Type** field values on the "Create contact expense mini page" (`CreateContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Create contact income mini page" (`CreateContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Create contact liability mini page" (`CreateContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas.<br>  <br>When adding financial data in an application context, with the "Application form" (`AppForm` code) present, the **Type** field values now exclude types already used in "Contact income in application form" (`ContactIncomeInAppForm` code), "Contact expense in application form" (`ContactExpenseInAppForm` code), and "Contact liability in application form" (`ContactLiabilityInAppForm` code) records linked to the same application form.<br>  <br>When adding data from the contact page, with the "Application form" (`AppForm` code) not present, the **Type** field values exclude types already used in the corresponding "Contact income" (`ContactIncome` code), "Contact expense" (`ContactExpense` code), and "Contact liability" (`ContactLiability` code) records for that contact.<br>  <br>- The **Type** field on the "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas to read-only. This behavior is managed by the "Make elements required: Frequency, Type, Amount" page-level business rule, ensuring consistent editing behavior.<br>  <br>- "Link financial records to application form" business process to ensure that only financial data records whose **Verification status** is "Not started" are linked to the "Application form" (`AppForm` code) object. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application page | Changed | Changed the visibility parameter of the **Add** button on the **Application forms** expanded list on the **Documents** tab of the application full page from "Visible" to "Not visible." This change prevents users from bypassing automated application form generation logic, reduces redundant actions, and enforces a standardized and controlled application form handling process. |
| Applications and credit processing | Application page | Changed | Added the ability to upload and manage required documents directly on the application full page during the "Underwriting" stage, aligning document handling with stage-specific requirements and existing submission behavior.<br>More details<br>Added:<br>- Upload functionality for the **Required documents** expanded list on the **Documents** tab of the application full page, matching the behavior previously available on the application submission page. The **Add** button and the upload area are now available only when the application is in the "Underwriting" stage. This behavior is managed by the "Show elements: Add required document, upload required document buttons" page-level business rule.<br>- **Delete** row action for the **Identity documents** and **Required documents** expanded lists on the **Documents** tab of the application full page. The deletion logic follows the same rules and restrictions as those applied on the application submission page. |
| Applications and credit processing | Evaluation management | Changed | Changed the KYC initiation process to prevent evaluations from starting when the application is no longer active. This change ensures process integrity and provides clearer feedback to users during evaluation attempts.<br>More details<br>- Added the **Evaluation restart not allowed** mini page ("Evaluation restart not allowed" (`EvaluationRestartNotAllowed_Validation_Dialog` code) schema of the "Client module" type).<br>- Changed the "Initiate KYC for application" business process. The process blocks evaluation launches for applications whose stage on the application full page is "Declined" or "Settled" and displays the **Evaluation restart not allowed** mini page when a user attempts to start an evaluation for such an application. |
| Applications and credit processing | Evaluation management | Changed | Changed the underwriting approval flow to automatically handle checks that become irrelevant after a negative decision, ensuring consistent processing across the evaluation workflow and preventing misclassification.<br>More details<br>Changed the "Initiate underwriting for application" business process so that when the **Current status** field on the **Underwriting** tab of the application full page is set to "Rejected," all related evaluation checks whose "Status" column in the **Evaluation history** expanded list on the **Compliance & risk monitoring** tab is "In progress" or "Not started" are automatically set to "Cancelled." Previously, such checks could only be marked as "Rejected," which caused confusion and did not accurately reflect the process outcome. |
| Applications and credit processing | Evaluation management | Changed | Improved the KYC evaluation restart flow on the application full page. This change enforces consistent evaluation handling during underwriting and reduces the risk of unsupported evaluation actions.<br>More details<br>- Changed:<br>  - **Evaluation history** expanded list on the **Evaluation history** tab of the application full page<br>    - Added the **Restart KYC evaluation** button. The button visibility is managed by the "Show elements: Restart KYC evaluation" page-level business rule. Out of the box, the button is visible only when the application is in the "Underwriting" stage.<br>    - Removed the **New** and **Actions** buttons to prevent unsupported evaluation entry points.<br>  - "Initiate KYC for application" business process to remove the **Evaluation history list mini page** previously used for selecting the evaluation process. When triggered manually, the process now launches the KYC evaluation out of the box.<br>- Replaced the **Launch evaluation** button with the **Restart KYC evaluation** button in the "Evaluation history list mini page" (`EvaluationHistoryList_MiniPage` code) schema to ensure a consistent user experience across components. |
| Applications and credit processing | Evaluation management | Changed | Improved the usability and performance of the **Evaluation history** expanded list on the **Evaluation history** tab of the application full page to ensure timely data visibility and faster evaluation tracking.<br>More details<br>- Added:<br>  - "Created on" column to the default list settings.<br>  - Automatic refresh logic after restarting a KYC evaluation to ensure the list reflects the latest evaluation data without requiring a manual page reload.<br>- Changed the "Generate evaluation for application" business process to create the "Evaluation history" (`EvaluationHistory` code) object record before running the "Generate mock automated KYC checks" subprocess, reducing latency when updating evaluation records. |
| Banking and financial products | Card management | Changed | Improved validation in the "Credit card limit change mini page" (`CreditCardLimitChange_MiniPage` code) schema to prevent entering negative values in the **Requested credit limit** field and provide clearer user guidance during limit change processing.<br>More details<br>Added the `crt.Min` validator to the source code of the "Credit card limit change mini page" (`CreditCardLimitChange_MiniPage` code) schema for the **Requested credit limit** field. The page cannot be saved if the entered value is less than 0. In this case, the field is highlighted in red and a "Minimum number value is 0" tooltip is displayed. |
| Financial documents | Document management | Changed | Improved the filtration logic in the **Document class** field on the **Select document class** mini page used during manual required document creation in application flows. This change ensures that only contextually valid and non-duplicate document classes are available for selection, improving compliance with document handling rules, and reducing errors during the evaluation process.<br>More details<br>Added a new `crt.SetIdentityDocumentFilter` request handler to the source code of the "Select document class mini page" (`SelectDocumentClass_MiniPage` code) schema. The request handler implements a new filtering rule for the **Document class** field value. The **Document class** field now allows selecting documents whose **Type** is "Compliance documents" and **Group** is "Consumer consent," or whose **Type** is "Customer documents" and **Group** is not "Identification," while additionally ensuring that the selected application does not already contain a document of the same class. |
| Financial documents | Contract management | Changed | Changed contract processing logic to automatically populate date fields on the contract page when a contract is created and signed during application processing. This change reduces manual data entry, ensures consistent date tracking, and improves accuracy when managing signed contracts in loan and deposit account application flows.<br>More details<br>Changed the "Process disbursement for loan application" and "Complete application for deposit account" business processes. When a contract is created and its **Status** field is set to "Signed" within these processes, the **Signed on** and **Start date** fields are populated with the current date automatically. |
| Apps and packages | Package dependencies | Changed | Changed the `CrtFinservAppMgmt` package dependencies by removing the outdated dependency on the legacy `BaseFinance` package. This change ensures that the application management layer relies only on relevant and actively supported packages. |
| Schema management | Schema inheritance | Changed | Changed the implementation of the "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas to separate application-specific versioning logic from the standard save behavior. This change improves separation of concerns between general contact data management and application-specific versioning logic, ensuring consistent behavior in financial applications while keeping **Customer 360** app functionality unchanged.<br>More details<br>- Added replaced schemas for the "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas to the `CrtFinservAppMgmt` package. These replaced schemas implement versioning-related functionality to ensure that versioning is applied only in the application context.<br>- Changed the corresponding "Contact expense mini page" (`ContactExpense_MiniPage` code), "Contact income mini page" (`ContactIncome_MiniPage` code), and "Contact liability mini page" (`ContactLiability_MiniPage` code) schemas in the `CrtFinservCstmr360` package so that the **Save** button uses only the default save logic. |
