## Creatio platform [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-2-3-energy-changelog\#title-creatio-platform "Direct link to Creatio platform")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Added | Validation of AI Skill parameter code was added to prevent conflict of overlapping codes between input and output AI Skill parameters. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Efficiency of fetching access permissions to multiple AI Skills was improved. Only permitted AI Skill codes are now returned while querying available AI Skills using API. This reduces processing overhead and enhances performance. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | **Creatio.ai skills** page was extended using information about access permissions binding. Configure access permissions to AI Skills and bind them to the package to ensure access permissions are applied correctly during export. Otherwise, the AI Skill is inaccessible after package installation to another environment. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Ability to manage access permissions to AI Skills for users and user groups in both "Chat" and "API" usage modes was added to control access to AI Skills and enhance system security.<br>More details<br>Changed the default value of the `GenAIFeatures.UseIntentSchemaOperationRights` additional feature to enabled. Previously, the feature was under beta testing. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Removed | The "Lookup" data type was removed from both **Input parameters** and **Output parameters** blocks in the **Creatio.ai skills** section and is no longer available to select for new parameters or modify existing parameters of the "Lookup" data type. Existing AI Skills that have parameters of the "Lookup" data type will remain unaffected. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat | Added | The limit of characters that can be included in a single message to Creatio.ai was added. The functionality is managed by the new "CreatioAIMaxUserQueryLength" (`CreatioAIMaxUserQueryLength` code) system setting. Out of the box, "8000." When you attempt to send a message longer than the limit, Creatio blocks the request and displays the localized message that notifies the user about the exceeded limit. This provides administrators with control over resource usage and prevents processing oversized requests. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Added | A new `RequiredPlatformVersion` property was added to the app-descriptor.json file. The property includes the earliest version of Creatio with which the app is compatible. If an app to install is incompatible with the Creatio version, the app cannot be installed. |
| Application Hub | App installation,<br>App update | Changed | Creatio now displays the **Application update** and **Application installation** windows even if you install an app from a file. The **Application installation** window includes the name of the app to add to Application Hub and list of packages to install when you try to install app or package without the app-descriptor.json file. If the app to install is published on Creatio Marketplace, the **Application update** and **Application installation** windows include the following information:<br>- Link to the app page on Creatio Marketplace<br>- Pricing model of the Marketplace app<br>- Version of the Marketplace app<br>- Brief notes on the Marketplace app updates (for single installation)<br>More details<br>- Deleted the **Modification date** field from the **Application update** and **Application installation** windows.<br>- Added the **Version** field to the **Application update** and **Application installation** windows. |

| Application Hub | App deployment | Security | The code security during app deployment was improved. Creatio now prevents using vulnerable code paths when deploying an app.<br>More details<br>- Added the `ProcessFeatures.IgnoreJsonTypeHandlingAll` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled for builds, apps deployed in the cloud and on-site.<br>- Added the `CommonFeatures.UseJsonHandleTypeNaming` additional feature. Out of the box, disabled for new apps and enabled for existing apps. |
| Application Hub | App templates | Removed | **Dashboards** template in the **Select the app** window of Application Hub was hidden. |
| Application Hub | Packages | Fixed | The error with the wrong hierarchy for automatically added package dependencies when converting a virtual package to a simple package was fixed. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Designer initialization | Changed | Initial state of the Freedom UI Designer was improved to provide more transparency when creating new pages and dashboards.<br>More details<br>Previously, when users opened a new page or widget, the Designer was loaded without additional announcement that it was ready to use, leading to proper page initialization questions. Now the Designer explicitly displays a blank canvas, indicating that you can proceed with the design. This improves the user experience. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Feature toggling list and form pages | Changed | Validation of code for **Feature toggling** list and form pages in Freedom UI Designer was added to comply with Creatio-wide code formatting rules. This prevents users from entering invalid or unsupported characters in the "Code" field ensuring consistency and avoiding potential issues caused by incorrect page codes. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Label component | Changed | The "Heading level" field was added to the Freedom UI Designer setup area of the **Label** component to improve page structuring and accessibility. Out of the box, the field value is `<label>`. Available values: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<label>`. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Search component | Changed | The **Search** component now supports filtering by direct links from related objects in widgets. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Changed | You can now turn on the record save indicator and customize the save message text in the Freedom UI Designer setup area of the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter is set to "Save data."<br>More details<br>Added the following properties that manage settings in the Freedom UI Designer setup area of the **Button** component whose "Action" field is set to "Save data":<br>- The `showSuccessMessage` property that manages the status of the **Show success message after completion** checkbox.<br>- The `messageTextAfterCompletion` property that populates the "Message text" field. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Fixed | The **Refresh data** button action now refreshes data while saving the page whose **Save** button has the **Stay on page after record is created** checkbox selected. This is useful for custom business logic that updates page fields while saving a page, such as a custom business process, and the new field values need to be displayed immediately after saving the page.<br>More details<br>Added a mode switch upon page saving. After saving the page, the mode switches from "Create/Copy" to "Update." |
| Freedom UI Designer | Toggle panel component | Changed | You can now set the spacing between tabs added to the `TabContainer` container of the **Toggle panel** component using low-code tools. This improves layout customization, design flexibility and enhances the visual page structure without affecting other page elements.<br>More details<br>Added the following spacing values: `small`, `medium`, `large` or `none`. You can set right, left, top and bottom spacing for tabs. The spacing between new tabs is aligned to the previous tab by default if the spacing is not changed. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Toggle panel component | Changed | A new "Dropdown" toggle view mode for **Toggle panel** component was added. This minimizes used page space. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Multi-select lookup component | Changed | A new read-only mode for the **Multi-select lookup** component was added. The functionality is managed by the **Read only** checkbox in the Freedom UI Designer setup area of the **Multi-select lookup** component. Out of the box, cleared. Additionally, business rules can activate the read-only mode.<br>More details<br>UI of the **Multi-select lookup** component was changed as follows for read-only mode:<br>- The **Remove** button for **Multi-select lookup** component value was hidden.<br>- The **Expand dropdown** icon in the "Dropdown" lookup view is replaced by a lock icon.<br>- The **Open modal window** icon in the "Selection window" lookup view is replaced by a lock icon.<br>- Tooltip is displayed with the lock icon. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Folders component | Changed | A new read-only mode for the **Folders** component was added. The functionality is managed by the `"readonly": true` value in the `values` property in the source code of the Freedom UI page.<br>More details<br>UI of the **Folders** component for read-only mode was changed as follows:<br>- The **Add** button for the **Folders** component was hidden.<br>- **Add to favorites**, **Setup filter**, **Show actions** buttons for a separate folder were hidden. |
| Freedom UI Designer | "Dropdown" type field | Fixed | The error of updating Freedom UI Designer setup area of a "Dropdown" type field after filling out the **Data source** parameter was fixed. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Object code | Changed | You can now customize object code when you create a data source or a list based on a new object in the Freedom UI Designer. Creatio can also generate a new object code automatically based on its title. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Object code | Fixed | The error of validating object code in Freedom UI Designer setup area when saving a page was fixed. This prevents creating objects that have incorrect codes.<br>More details<br>- Added the validator that restricts usage of invalid characters.<br>- Added validator that prevents usage of already existing code for another object. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Element recreation | Changed | The recreation of elements in the DOM when you interact with it on the Freedom UI Designer canvas was optimized. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Cyclic dependency check | Added | Check for cyclic dependencies in the `lookup` type columns between new objects when saving a page in Freedom UI Designer was added. Additionally, the order of saving dependent objects was fixed. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Performance | Changed | Memory usage in Freedom UI Designer was optimized during page design. Extra animations were disabled to improve performance and stability.<br>More details<br>Previously, some animations in Freedom UI Designer contributed to increased memory consumption, leading to potential performance issues during extended design sessions. Disabling these animations reduces unnecessary memory overhead and improves overall responsiveness to edit pages in the Freedom UI Designer smoother. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Page saving | Fixed | The error of saving pages in Freedom UI Designer when duplicate localizable strings were present was fixed. Creatio now automatically removes duplicates during the page saving to avoid cleaning duplicates manually. The functionality is managed by the `InterfaceDesigner.DisableLocalizableStringDeduplication` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. If the error of saving pages occurs again and you have to change the status of the `InterfaceDesigner.DisableLocalizableStringDeduplication` additional feature, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to implement changes in the platform. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Data model attribute | Fixed | The error of updating data model attribute captions in Freedom UI Designer if the caption was changed before the `GetSchemaDesignItem` request is completes was fixed. |
| Integrations | Identity Service | Changed | The Identity Service now supports handling JSON Web Tokens encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm when active as an identity provider for Creatio over OAuth. This enables secure authentication and compatibility with modern OAuth implementations, increasing flexibility and integration options.<br>More details<br>The following combinations of ECDSA-encrypted JWT tokens are supported:<br>- P-256 with SHA-256<br>- P-384 with SHA-384<br>- P-521 with SHA-512 |
| Integrations | OAuth authentication,<br>OpenID authentication | Changed | Creatio now supports handling JSON Web Tokens encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm when active OAuth or OpenID. This enables secure authentication and compatibility with modern OAuth implementations, increasing flexibility and integration options.<br>More details<br>The following combinations of ECDSA-encrypted JWT tokens are supported:<br>- P-256 with SHA-256<br>- P-384 with SHA-384<br>- P-521 with SHA-512 |
| Integrations | Webhooks | Changed | Creatio now only parses webhooks explicitly specified in the **Webhook entities** lookup into objects. Out of the box, Creatio parses webhooks of "Contact," "Lead," "Order," and "Submitted form" objects. Webhooks that reference object codes not included in the lookup are blocked and logged for future reference. To retrieve blocked webhooks, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com). This enhances system security. |
| Business processes | Call Creatio.ai element | Changed | Support for "Collection of records" type of input parameter in the **Call Creatio.ai** business process element was added. The "Collection of records" type can be used if the type of input AI Skill parameter is set to "Serializable list of composite values."<br>More details<br>"Collection of records" type is applicable for parent collection only and available as serializable list of composite values. Selecting a set of nested collection elements is impossible. |
| Business processes | Call Creatio.ai element | Fixed | The error of handling direction of nested parameters was fixed. Business processes that have the **Call Creatio.ai** element now ignore parameter direction while processing nested parameters in composite objects, and Creatio perceives parameters as bidirectional to ensure consistent behavior and avoid configuration errors. |
| Business processes | User task element | Changed | The execution logic of the `ChangeAdminRightsUserTask` user task was optimized to improve performance and efficiency of system resource usage when assigning access permissions.<br>More details<br>Previously, if the **Apply access rights to all records that match conditions** checkbox was selected, the task received the values of all columns. Now the task receives only the necessary columns. |
| Business processes | Page navigation | Fixed | The error with a blank text parameter of a business process that receives a GUID value instead of remaining empty was fixed. This occurred when navigating between auto-generated pages without data entry. The functionality is managed by the `ProcessFeatures.UseDefaultEmptyStringForTextParameters` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. This ensures that text parameters receive an empty string value if they are not filled out explicitly. |
| Business processes | Process parameters | Fixed | The "Value" field on the **Parameters** tab of the Process Designer is now filled out correctly. Previously, when the "Data type" field was set to "Collection of records" and the "Direction" field was set to "Output," the "Value" field remained blank. Additionally, the error with clearing the "Value" field when closing the setup panel of the Process Designer was fixed. This ensures correct data mapping when configuring the collection of records parameters in business processes. |
| Business processes | DCM case execution | Fixed | Fixed the error where corrupted data in the DCM database tables could have impacted the runtime due to recent optimization changes. This update introduces measures to prevent such data from disrupting DCM processing logic. |
| Business rules | Trigger | Added | Trigger text in the Business Rule Designer is now dynamic and describes when the actions will trigger the business rule. |
| Business rules | Trigger | Fixed | The error with generating triggers for the same attribute codes in different data sources was fixed. |
| Business rules | Business rule deletion | Fixed | The error of accidentally deleting business rules when saving pages in Freedom UI Designer was fixed. The functionality is managed by the `FixDeletingAddonsWhenParallelPackages` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. Business rules for all packages are now clearly identified and saved when saving changes. This prevents unintentional data loss and improves the reliability of business rule management in the Freedom UI Designer.<br>More details<br>Previously, when business rules were stored in packages at the same hierarchy level, Freedom UI Designer did not display all existing business rules. If you modified the business rules, the non-displayed business rules could be deleted when saving pages in Freedom UI Designer. |
| End user experience | Screen reader support | Added | The screen reader now announces the following:<br>- when chart type is changed<br>- status of hidden chart series without additional information |
| End user experience | Screen reader support | Added | When you click the **Export to Excel** action in sections, the screen reader now announces when the file is being prepared for export. |

| End user experience | Contact compact profile component,<br>Account compact profile component | Fixed | The error with displaying the window for editing the **Contact compact profile** and **Account compact profile** components on a screen whose width is fewer than 600 px was fixed. The window is now displayed at the bottom of the screen. |
| End user experience | Folders component | Added | You can now move folders among parent folders to improve folder structure management.<br>More details<br>Added the **Move** item to the folder actions menu of the **Folders** component. To move folder:<br>1. Click the **Move** item. This opens a window that displays folder hierarchy.<br>2. Select a new parent folder. |
| End user experience | Button component | Added | When you execute the **Refresh data** button action, the message about updating data is displayed and the screen reader now announces when data is updated. The functionality is managed by a new `showSuccessMessage` property of the `crt.LoadDataRequest` request handler. If the `showSuccessMessage` property is set to `true`, the message about updating data is displayed. |
| End user experience | List component | Added | A new item **Overwrite current list settings for all users** was added to the list menu. The action deletes all changes made by users from the `SysProfileData` database table and then updates existing default list settings in the `SysProfileData` database table for "All employees" and "All external users" groups. The functionality is managed by the "List setup for all users" (`CanCreateDefaultGridSettings` code) system operation.<br>More details<br>- Changed business logic of storing page changes. Previously, all page changes together with lists were stored in one record. Now list settings are stored separately: one record in the `SysProfileData` database table for each list. Loading lists does not affect page performance because all the list settings on the page are selected using a single query.<br>  <br>- Supported backward compatibility with previous versions of list setting metadata. Additionally, old metadata will be automatically deleted from database and new list settings will be saved as soon as you make any changes in a list.<br>  <br>- Added a new `"sysAdminUnitIds": string[]` parameter to the `UserSchemaProfile` endpoint that saves list settings to a user profile. The `sysAdminUnitIds` parameter replaces the `sysAdminUnitId` parameter that is now deprecated.<br>  <br>- Added a new `QuerySchemaProfiles` endpoint that reads profile settings. Resulting profile data for a list of keys corresponds to the most recent saved data within the current role hierarchy.<br>  <br>For example, the role hierarchy is as follows: All employees → Sales Department → Andrew Baker.<br>  <br>The resulting profile data is handled as follows: if Andrew Baker has saved profile data, profile data is returned. Otherwise, the data for the "Sales Department" role is returned. If data for the "Sales Department" role is omitted, data for the "All employees" role is returned. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | The error of calculating values in list views when filtering nested objects was fixed. This enhances system stability and improves the reliability of calculated fields that use filters.<br>More details<br>In version 8.2.1, attempts to display calculated fields, for example, via **Event** → **Lead** → **Opportunity** → **Opportunity Amount**, that had a filter applied, for example, "Stage," caused the section view to crash.<br>Adjusted the mechanism that builds sub-filters. Now filters that use the `[Schema:SchemaColumn:Column].SomeColumn.Id + Subfilter` template are executed correctly without causing section crashes. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | The error of removing filter condition when disabling the root filter group for aggregative column in the **List** component was fixed. Previously, even after disabling the root filter group, the filter condition was applied and led to incorrect results. When the root filter group is disabled and changes are saved, the filter condition is now correctly excluded from the request execution. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | The error of copying text in the **List** component was fixed. The text is now copied even if the `"selection": false` value is in the `cells` property in the source code of the Freedom UI page. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | The error with broken styles in the **List** component was fixed. The styles no longer break when the `"visible": false` value is in the `header` property. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | The column caption is now displayed when you drag the column in the **List** component. |
| End user experience | 2FA | Added | The configuration of the translation service used for 2FA and password recovery pages was extended by a full list of supported languages. Previously, these pages only displayed a limited set of localized languages, which caused missing localizations for some users. All languages supported by the platform are now available on these pages. |
| End user experience | "Dropdown" type field | Changed | Title of the **Open section** button that opens selection window of the "Dropdown" type field was added to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | "Dropdown" type field | Fixed | The error of UI overlap in the "Dropdown" type field was fixed. Previously, an icon of the "Dropdown" type field was displayed over the placeholder text when a long placeholder and tooltip were used. The icon of the "Dropdown" type field is now correctly positioned next to the placeholder to ensure proper alignment and visual clarity. |
| End user experience | Desktop selection | Changed | - Keyboard support for desktop selection button was added. You can also press Ctrl+Shift+E to open the Freedom UI Designer for selected desktop if you have permissions to do so.<br>- The desktop selection button no longer overlaps the content.<br>- Background and border were added for better visibility on light backgrounds. |
| End user experience | User profile button | Changed | Size of the user profile button in the top panel was adjusted from 32 px to 25 px including the outline border to better align with the app design. |
| End user experience | Action dashboard component,<br>Progress bar component | Changed | The color palette in the **Action dashboard** and **Progress bar** components was changed to comply with Web Accessibility Guidelines. The changes improve visual accessibility by aligning the color palette with accessibility standards, enhancing clarity and readability for users that have visual impairments. |
| End user experience | Tabs component,<br>Toggle panel component | Changed | The selectors of the **Tabs** and **Toggle panel** components were changed. Previous styling of the **Tabs** and **Toggle panel** components using `mat-` selectors could potentially break the component styles. |
| End user experience | Notification marks | Changed | Color of notification marks in the top panel and nested panels was changed to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | Communication options | Changed | `title` and `aria-label` properties in the DOM were added for action menu items of communication options to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | Communication options | Fixed | The error that prevented pages from loading when using communication options that have specific input types in a newly created apps was fixed.<br>More details<br>The `communication-options.module` now explicitly includes the necessary modules such as `CrtInputModule`, `CrtPhoneInputModule`, `CrtEmailInputModule`, and `CrtWebInputModule` in the `includes` property to ensure that the corresponding field types work as expected when added to the page.<br>Previously, after you created a new app and added a component whose type is `crt.Input` as a communication option, the page failed to load due to omitted module declarations. All required input modules are now directly included in the module configuration. Out of the box, the "DisableFreedomUiLazyLoading" (`DisableFreedomUiLazyLoading` code) system setting temporarily resolves the issue to ensure reliable initialization and use of communication options in custom apps, improving stability and developer experience. |
| End user experience | Attachments component | Changed | The `target-area` property in the DOM of the **Actions** button in the **Attachments** component was changed. Additionally, contrast for date and file size in the "Gallery" view of the **Attachments** component was added and styles of keyboard focus indicator for the **Attachments** component were improved.<br>More details<br>- For the "Gallery" view of the **Attachments** component whose "Gallery item size" field is set to "XL," Creatio displays the file upload date and time out of the box and on mouse hover.<br>- For other sizes of the "Gallery item size" field, Creatio displays only the file upload date out of the box. The file upload date and time is displayed on mouse hover. |
| End user experience | Classic UI dashboards | Changed | Loading of Classic UI dashboards on the page that has folders, tags, or filters applied was optimized. The functionality is managed by the `DisableDashboardFolderFilterOptimization` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. |
| End user experience | Filter setup | Changed | The UX of the **Setup filters** window to set up filters of the aggregation column was improved to comply with WCAG and improve its usability on screens that have small width.<br>More details<br>Added a new **Setup filter** button that opens the initial filter settings. Once the filter is set up, the button name changes to **Edit filter**. |
| End user experience | Record adding | Fixed | The loading mask is now displayed when adding a new record after a page refresh. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Fixed | Records in the **Timeline** component are now displayed for external users who have Classic UI enabled. |
| End user experience | Progress bar component | Fixed | The error of losing color highlight for progress bar stages when pointing the mouse after changing a stage and clicking the "Cancel" button was fixed. It was caused by losing mouse event subscriptions while loading the view model. The progress bar re-rendering hook to correctly handle `handleFinishLoadViewModelAttributes()` is updated and event subscriptions and color highlight of progress bar stages are no longer lost. |
| End user experience | List settings | Fixed | Maximum width of the frozen column is now 70% of the list width for regular lists and 30% for narrow lists. |
| End user experience | List settings | Fixed | The loading mask is now displayed when managing list settings. |
| End user experience | Classic UI selection window | Fixed | When you switch among tabs in the Classic UI selection window that has an arbitrary value in the "Search" field, the "Search" field is now cleared. |
| End user experience | Emails | Fixed | The error of inserting a link into the signature tag while editing the email body on the email page or in the **Message composer** component was fixed. |
| End user experience | Access permissions | Fixed | The error with user access permissions caching for details in Classic UI was fixed. User access permissions no longer affect system administrators' access to detail settings. |
| End user experience | Customer Classic UI container | Fixed | The error of duplicate values in the **Customer** container when enabling **Opportunities** Classic UI section was fixed.<br>More details<br>Previously, when Classic UI was enabled, the **Customer** container displayed duplicate values and led to visual inconsistencies and potential confusion. The **Customer** container now correctly displays unique values, improving data clarity and user experience in the Classic UI. |
| End user experience | Technical users | Removed | The "New" badge in the **Technical users** section within the System Designer was removed. |
| Advanced customization | Warning messages | Added | Additional warning messages were added in the Object Designer, Source Code Designer, and User Task Designer to alert users about actions that can cause performance degradation. Those messages were enabled only for environments whose **Environment type** (`EnvironmentType` code) system setting is set to "Production." |
| Advanced customization | System settings | Added | A new **Environment type** (`EnvironmentType` code) system setting that determines environment type was added. Available values: "Production," "Pre-production," "Development." The system setting value is populated while creating a new environment and is used only to display additional warning messages that could potentially degrade environment performance. This message is enabled only for production environments. |
| Advanced customization | Business process running | Added | The mechanism that runs business processes using `ProcessEngineService` service of the `@creatio-devkit/common` library was added.<br>More details<br>Previously, running a business process did not automatically include the execution context, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior. Business processes are now initiated using the `ProcessEngineService` service of the `@creatio-devkit/common` library that transfers execution context accurately, enabling stable and predictable business logic execution while automation and development. |
| Advanced customization | "Rich text" type field | Changed | You can add the **Video** formatting option to the toolbar of the "Rich text" type field using low-code tools. Out of the box, enabled for knowledge base articles. This functionality requires external domains to be added as trusted sources in the **Content Security Policy** section. YouTube and Vimeo domains were added out of the box. |
| Advanced customization | Freedom UI component loading | Fixed | The logic of loading Freedom UI component on the page in runtime mode was optimized. The functionality is managed by the `LoadLazyModuleEvenIfItemIsNonLazy` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. If a new error occurs and you have to change the status of the `LoadLazyModuleEvenIfItemIsNonLazy` additional feature, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to implement changes in the platform.<br>More details<br>Previously, redundant component code could be loaded on the page even if the component itself was not added to the page and the component was loaded only when needed, i. e., the lazy loading approach was supported. |
| Advanced customization | Filters | Fixed | The error of incorrect filter inheritance between parent and child pages when replacing a page and using the new API was fixed. Child pages now use their own filters and no longer inherit parent page filters after updating the base page. The change affects the **Search**, **Quick filter**, **Folders** components.<br>More details<br>Added validation of bindings for the `_filterOptions` and `filterAttributes` properties. |
| Advanced customization | Angular version update | Changed | The unused `intersection-observer` package was removed from the package.json file. This cleanup is part of the preparations for the Angular version update and helps to reduce unnecessary dependencies in the project.<br>More details<br>Previously, this package was included to support the `ng-in-viewport` library. Following the migration to the native browser `IntersectionObserver` API, the external dependency is no longer necessary. |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migration of `crt-` components from the outdated version of the Angular Material library to the latest version was started. The migration is performed in multiple stages and upcoming releases will already include migrated components. Learn more about `crt-` components that got migrated to the latest version of the Angular Material library in upcoming changelogs. Component migration only affects users who violated our recommendation and overrode the default component styles.<br>More details<br>Previously styled components that use internal Angular Material classes or selectors, such as `mat-`, can change, remove or break the component styles after update to the Creatio version that includes the already migrated components. |
| Advanced customization | Process execution security | Security | The security and maintainability of process deserialization mechanisms were improved by addressing unsafe deserialization practices in `Terrasoft.Common.Json.JsonDataReader`. This improves platform security, simplifies code maintenance, and supports long-term stability.<br>More details<br>- Removed the `JsonDataReader.GetSerializableObjectValue` method. A warning was added to the compiler to prevent method usage. Previously, process deserialization mechanisms used the deprecated `JsonDataReader.GetSerializableObjectValue` deserialization method that could potentially expose the platform to unsafe deserialization attacks, and alternative safe methods were not implemented. A list of alternative methods was added to the compiler warning.<br>- Added the `CommonFeatures.ReturnNullWithoutTypeHandling` additional feature that restricts deserialization behavior, reducing attack vectors and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities to align with the best practices for handling untrusted input data. |
| Administration | Cache performance | Changed | Cache performance on .NET 8 and .NET Framework was optimized. Unnecessary requests to the server that revalidate the configuration content were reduced. |
| Administration | Cache performance | Changed | Cache performance was optimized and memory consumption was reduced in Redis for the `LicHelper` mechanism. |
| Administration | Data binding | Added | The previously omitted data binding for the `CanManageSchemaRights` system operation that manages schema access permissions was added. The `CanManageSchemaRights` system operation is enabled out of the box for system administrators, but does not affect access permissions to AI Skills. |
| Administration | Logging | Added | Ability to log SQLite database re-generation events was added to track, investigate and prevent database corruption and automatic re-generation events and improve system transparency.<br>More details<br>Added a new "Log operations with runtime metadata of entity schema" (`UseRuntimeMetadataOfEntitySchemaLog` code) system setting that logs runtime metadata re-generation events. Out of the box, enabled.<br>Previously, SQLite database corruption and automatic re-generation occurred without any notification. Now every re-generation event is logged in the audit log. |
| Administration | Translations | Added | A new "Validate translations" business process that validates translations in Creatio was added. The business process identifies inconsistencies, ensuring that the translations displayed to users are correct, saves time and reduces human error.<br>More details<br>Previously, system administrators checked translations in the UI manually and it was time-consuming to ensure that translations were applied correctly. The business process now automatically compares the translated values from the **Translation** section with the values displayed in the app UI. When the process execution is complete, the system displays a notification in the communication panel. Click the link within the notification to display the detailed report. |
| Administration | Translations | Changed | The logic that manages the number of parallel threads allocated for the "Apply translations" and "Actualize translations" business processes execution was improved. Now the number of parallel threads does not exceed the number of CPU cores, regardless of the "Apply translation concurrency limit" (`ApplyTranslationConcurrencyLimit` code) and "Translation update task concurrency limit" (`TranslationUpdateTaskConcurrencyLimit` code) system settings, improving stability and performance during translation updates and application tasks.<br>More details<br>Changed the default value for the "Translation update task concurrency limit" (`TranslationUpdateTaskConcurrencyLimit` code) system setting to "0" that triggers an improved auto-calculation of the threads based on available CPU cores. Previously, specifying a large number of parallel threads could result in excessive CPU usage and performance degradation if the number of threads exceeded the available cores. This ensures efficient resource usage and prevents performance issues related to thread over-usage. |
| Administration | Translations | Changed | Database queries used in the translation update process were optimized to use database indexes effectively, reducing performance of database server CPU up to 40% and speeding up the process up to 11 times.<br>More details<br>Previously, inefficient database queries resulted in high CPU utilization and performance degradation when updating translations. By optimizing these queries for proper index usage, Creatio now handles the translation update process more efficiently. |
| Administration | Translations | Changed | Translation application action now checks whether translations in the UI and **Translation** section are consistent before deciding which records to apply. If you execute the application action for a single culture, Creatio limits translation checking to that culture only.<br>More details<br>Previously, discrepancies could arise when translations were applied as Creatio applied translations only if `isChanged=true`. Translation updates are now based on the actual differences between the translated values from the **Translation** section and the values displayed in the app UI. Validation of translations is skipped if you use the **Force apply all translations** checkbox. |
| Administration | Translations | Fixed | The error with omitting or incorrectly displaying translations of page resources due to incorrect initialization of the resource manager was fixed. Now the resource manager is initialized without errors to apply translations consistently, improving localization accuracy and user experience. |
| Administration | Chats | Changed | Access to chat queues from the form page is now managed by the `CanManageChats` system operation. |
| Administration | Statistics | Changed | Security of the `MessageBusManagementService.svc` service was improved. To access the `GetStatistics` service endpoint, users require permission to the "Can manage configuration elements" (`CanManageSolution` code) system operation. |
| Administration | Identity Service | Changed | PFX certificate generation for Windows Server 2016 was improved to increase system compatibility and reduce manual configuration.<br>More details<br>Previously, the out-of-the-box script that generated PFX certificates did not guarantee Windows Server 2016 compatibility, which could potentially cause problems when using certificates.<br>For Windows Server versions above 2016, the script behavior remains unchanged, ensuring consistent functionality. |
| Administration | Identity Service | Changed | The PFX sample certificate was removed from the IdentityService.zip archive, which ensures generation and usage of a unique certificate and reduces the risk of certificate duplication.<br>More details<br>Previously, the IdentityService.zip archive included a sample PFX certificate that could potentially lead to unintended usage of a non-unique certificate in production environments. |
| Administration | Classic UI timeline,<br>Classic UI feed | Changed | The link preview functionality that manages link preview in the Classic UI timeline and feed was removed. |
| Administration | Organizational roles | Fixed | The error with non-working filtering in the **Users** expanded list of the **Users** tab in the **Organizational roles** section was fixed. |
| Administration | 2FA | Fixed | The error of bypassing 2FA when usernames match names of organizational roles in the **Organizational roles** section was fixed. This ensures that the common 2FA requirements are applied for all users. |
| Administration | Feature toggling | Fixed | The error with incorrect display of date and time in the "Created on" and "Modified on" columns on the **Feature toggling** page was fixed.<br>More details<br>Previously, the "Created on" and "Modified on" columns displayed the current date and time for additional features. Now the columns display the date and time retrieved from the database. If the additional feature is unregistered in the database and it is impossible to retrieve its date and time, the fields of the "Created on" and "Modified on" columns display "-." |
| Administration | Backward compatibility | Fixed | The response structure for .NET 8 was standardized to correspond to the response structure for .NET Framework, ensuring backward compatibility.<br>More details<br>Previously, the `resultParameterValues` property for .NET 8 was an array of key-value objects, while for .NET Framework it was a key-value pair object. This caused issues with interoperability and execution of automated API tests that assume consistency in response structure. |

| Email marketing | Bulk emails | Fixed | The error of incorrect link processing in URLs inside a bulk email was fixed. Now the "?" character that comes immediately after the "#" character does not affect link processing. |
| Creatio Sales | Translations | Removed | Duplicate localization strings were removed from form pages to improve system optimization and decrease potential localization-related errors.<br>More details<br>Removed duplicate localization strings from `Accounts_FormPage`, `Contacts_FormPage`, `Leads_FormPage`, `Orders_FormPage`, `Documents_FormPage`. |
| Lead and Opportunity Management | Sales homepage | Changed | The column referenced by the "Sales pipeline" widget on the **Sales homepage** was changed.<br>More details<br>Previously, the widget was referencing the "Amount" column instead of "Budget," resulting in a quantity mismatch on the **Sales homepage** and **Lead and Opportunity homepage**. |
| Lead and Opportunity Management | Leads | Changed | Performance of the **Similar leads** expanded list was optimized on PostgreSQL for "Lead" objects that have multiple custom columns. |
| Lead and Opportunity Management | Lead pipeline | Fixed | The error with simultaneous display of current and outdated "Qualification," "Sales qualified lead" and "Marketing qualified lead" stages on the **Lead pipeline** in the analytics view was fixed.<br>More details<br>Out of the box, "Sales qualified lead" and "Marketing qualified lead" stages in `BuildEngine` are disabled for Classic UI. `UpdateScenarios` manages the display of current stages, including "Sales qualified lead" and "Marketing qualified lead," and forbids displaying outdated stages, including "Qualification," in new environments. |
| Case Management | Cases | Changed | The value of the "Filter column" field for **Tags** component on the **Cases** list page in Freedom UI Designer was changed from `Tag` to `[CaseInTag:Entity].Tag`. The tag list is now available to use in the **Cases** section. |
