Level: beginner

You can set up workplaces in the Mobile Wizard. The Mobile Wizard lets you do the following:

- view the list of available workplaces
- add new workplaces
- change the settings of the existing workplaces

Out of the box, the mobile application has a single primary workplace. As a rule, mobile app workplaces are configured by Creatio administrators.

Installing Creatio marketplace extensions (e.g., Field Sales) can add more workplaces.

note
