The **Tasks** section in the mobile application is synchronized with the primary Creatio application and can be used both offline and online (Fig. 1).

Tasks can be displayed either as a virtual organizer or a drop-down list. **Calendar** mode displays the tasks for which you are responsible and those in which you were added as a participant. **List** mode displays only the tasks for which you are responsible. You can select the view (drop-down list or calendar) in the upper area of the workspace area.

Depending on the size of your mobile device screen, the default calendar view is for the current day or the current week. If necessary, you can change the display period of the schedule.

note

The calendar view period can differ due to the work limitations of different mobile devices. For tablets, the schedule in the **Tasks** section can be changed to weekly or daily mode. For mobile phones, the schedule is always displayed daily.

Tap anywhere on the blank calendar space and swipe right to go to the next day or left to go to the previous day.

The current time is indicated using an orange line.

In the calendar area, all activities are displayed as rectangular blocks whose height corresponds to the duration of the activity.

On the left side of the calendar area, time intervals are displayed.

Activities in the calendar view are highlighted using different colors depending on their status and due date.

- Activities are highlighted red when their due time has already passed and they are not in the final state yet.

- Activities are highlighted blue when their due time has not passed and they are not in the final state yet (scheduled or in progress)

- Activities are highlighted grey if they are in the final state (completed or canceled).
