note

This functionality is only available for Classic UI pages.

Your personal cloud key and the URL to Creatio cloud services are required to use data enrichment. Use the following system settings to specify these values:

- "Account enrichment service URL". By default, this setting is populated for all applications.
- "Creatio cloud services API key". This setting is populated for **cloud** applications by default but needs to be configured for **on-site** applications.

Request your personal key for your **on-site** application from the Creatio support. After receiving the key:

1. In the system designer, click the **System settings** link.

2. Go to the **Creatio cloud services** group, and select the **Creatio cloud services API key** system setting.

3. Specify the key in the **Default value** field and click **Save**

Data enrichment functions can now be used.
