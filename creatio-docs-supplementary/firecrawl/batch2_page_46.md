You can configure access to object permissions based on permissions for system operations. This lets you restrict general access to an object but still enable users that have specific permissions to interact with the object as needed.

Users that have permissions for an administrated operation receive the specified access permissions to the object. If a user has permissions for multiple operations that grant access to the same object, the access permissions are combined. Any other access permissions granted directly to the object are also combined with these permissions.

To set up object permissions by system operations:

1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/object_permissions_by_system_operations/btn_system_designer.png) to **Open the System Designer**.
2. **Go to** the **Users and administration** block → **Operation permissions**.
3. **Open** the relevant operation permission.
4. **Click**![btn_add.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/object_permissions_by_system_operations/btn_add.png) in the **Object access granted by operation** detail.
5. **Click**![btn_search.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/object_permissions_by_system_operations/btn_search.png) → select the relevant object → **Select**.
6. **Select the checkboxes** in **Read**, **Edit**, **Create**, or **Delete** columns to grant the corresponding permissions to the user.
7. **Click**![btn_confirm.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/object_permissions_by_system_operations/btn_confirm.png).

**As a result**, users that have access to the corresponding system operation will be able to execute the selected operations with object data.
