To prevent blocking Creatio Cloud in cases where you have to restrict traffic in your company, you have to to allow traffic to Creatio Cloud data centers. Creatio has a number of AWS and Azure data centers located worldwide to enable high availability and faster response time.

Each entry lists the primary IP address and the secondary IP address. The CNAME contains both primary and secondary IP addresses in failover mode and will automatically redirect to a live IP address if one of them is down.
