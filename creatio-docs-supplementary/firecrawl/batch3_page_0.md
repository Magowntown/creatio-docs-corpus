This is documentation for Creatio **8.2**.

For up-to-date documentation, see the **[latest version](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/administration/user-and-access-management/user-management/assign-a-user-role)** (8.3).

Version: 8.2

On this page

User groups in Creatio are called **"roles"**. You can assign organizational and functional roles to users in Creatio. Read more in " [User and role management, access permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/online-courses/user-and-role-management-access-permissions)".

The assigned roles provide users with access to corresponding Creatio [data objects](https://academy.creatio.com/online-courses/creatio-object-data-model) and general [system-wide functions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=258). You can specify several roles for a user.

note

By default, Creatio assigns the "All employees" organizational role to the newly added users of the "Employee" type.

There are two ways you can assign roles to a user:

- From the user page
- From the role page

## Method 1. Assign roles to a user from the user page [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/8.2/administration/user-and-access-management/user-management/assign-a-user-role\#title-289-1 "Direct link to Method 1. Assign roles to a user from the user page")

1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_system_designer.png) → System Designer → **System users**.

2. Open the user page → the **Roles** tab.

3. On the **Organizational roles** detail, click ![btn_com_add_tab.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_com_add_tab.png) and specify the roles from the company's organizational structure.

4. On the **Functional roles** detail, click ![btn_com_add_tab00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_com_add_tab00001.png) and specify the user’s functional role. Functional roles are usually based on the user’s job title (Fig. 1).

As a result, the user will be granted all permissions relevant to the assigned roles.

## Method 2. Assign roles to a user from the role page [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/8.2/administration/user-and-access-management/user-management/assign-a-user-role\#title-289-2 "Direct link to Method 2. Assign roles to a user from the role page")

1. Click ![btn_system_designer00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_system_designer00002.png) → **Organizational roles**.

2. In the list of organizational roles (represented in the form of a folder tree), **select the corresponding organization and/or division**. This will bring up the selected role page to the right.

3. On the **Users** tab:
1. Click ![btn_com_add_tab00003.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_com_add_tab00003.png) and select **Add existing** to **add an existing user**. In the pop-up window, select the corresponding user (Fig. 1).
2. Click ![btn_com_add_tab00004.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_com_add_tab00004.png) and select **Add new** to **add a new user** assigned to this role (you will need to populate the new user page).
4. To assign a functional role to the user, switch to the **Functional roles** view by clicking ![btn_users_func_roles.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/assigning_roles/btn_users_func_roles.png), then **select the corresponding functional role**.

5. Repeat step 4 (Fig. 1).

As a result, the user will be added to the corresponding roles and granted relevant permissions.
