## Creatio platform [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-platform "Direct link to Creatio platform")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents | Added | Added AI Agents — new entities that group skills and provide contextual awareness. All communication with Creatio.ai in "Chat" mode is now routed through agents. Agents are available in the new **Creatio.ai agents** section within the "AI command center" workplace. This enhancement improves task processing accuracy and enables handling a wide range of area-specific tasks, such as case or service request handling, via a dedicated agent. Agents are built using an extended schema type specifically designed for Creatio.ai. The functionality is managed by the `GenAIFeatures.UseCopilotAgents` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled.<br>More details<br>Added the following agents:<br>- "Creatio.ai Agent" is a universal agent designed to handle non-specific or unassigned tasks — tasks for which no specialized agent currently exists.<br>- "Email generation agent" is a Marketing agent that helps users create, edit, and structure brand-consistent, data-driven marketing emails tailored to email goals and audience segments. Requires **Email Marketing** app.<br>- "Productivity agent" is a Marketing agent that supports users with essential productivity tasks such as scheduling meetings, rewriting or extending messages, and improving communication tone. Help streamline day-to-day work by reducing manual coordination and enhancing written content quality. Requires **Productivity** app.<br>- "Sales agent" supports the full sales lifecycle at Creatio — from lead qualification to opportunity closure — by automating repetitive tasks. Requires **Sales** app.<br>- "Case resolution agent" is a Service agent that analyzes support cases and recommends the most effective next steps to resolve issues. Uses historical case data, linked knowledge articles, and AI reasoning to generate response options for agents. Requires **Case Management** app.<br>- "Knowledge agent" is a Service agent that continuously improves the knowledge base by drafting new articles from user prompts or resolved cases, recommending updates to existing articles. Designed to enable self-service and boost efficiency. Requires **Knowledge Management** app.<br>Previously, users interacted directly with individual skills. With this update, all interactions are mediated by agents that organize and manage the execution of relevant skills. This results in a more structured and controlled AI behavior. To maintain backward compatibility, a special update script assigns all unlinked skills to the default agent during system upgrade. After the update, we recommend reviewing custom skills and associating them with the appropriate agents using the agent page. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents | Added | Added the ability to add and manage key attributes for agents directly from app UI based on a standardized structure similar to skills. Agents are available in the new **Creatio.ai agents** section within the "AI command center" workplace. This enhancement improves control, clarity, and the overall setup experience for AI-driven features in no-code environments.<br>More details<br>You can specify the following fields on the agent page: "Title," "Code," "Status," "Role," "Agent instructions," "Limitations and restrictions," "AI skills," "AI actions." All fields include appropriate placeholders and tooltips to assist the user in data entry. Additionally, the "AI actions" expanded list enables users to associate specific actions with each agent configuration. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents | Added | Temporarily disabled verification for access permissions to agents. When an agent is involved, the system bypasses permission checks to ensure uninterrupted operation. The update does not affect access permissions to skills. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Improved GUID and URL handling in skills used in "API" mode to ensure valid output. Adjusted skill responses to eliminate malformed links and improperly formatted GUIDs, aligning behavior with outputs of skills used in "Chat" mode and enhancing supportability. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Added a new "Enrich opportunity" AI Skill that enriches opportunity pages in the **Lead and Opportunity Management** app by utilizing meeting transcripts.<br>More details<br>When a user uploads or generates a transcript, Creatio.ai analyzes the content and updates "Total contract value," "Decision maker," "Expected close date," "Customer need" fields and fields under the **Customer perspective** expanded list on the opportunity page directly from the conversation context.<br>Previously, users manually reviewed and added data from meeting notes. Now, the "Enrich opportunity" AI Skill automatically handles information and extracts data to streamline the post-meeting workflow. This enhancement ensures data accuracy, reduces manual efforts, maintains up-to-date and data-rich records gathered from customer conversations, and improves the quality of records that are important for forecasting and sales process alignment.<br>Additionally, the "Enrich opportunity" AI Skill includes a mechanism to preview suggested updates before they are applied to the Creatio instance. This enhancement lets you make informed decisions about the need for changes based on analyzing the meeting transcript. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Updated an "Enrich account data" AI Skill that enriches account pages in the **Customer 360** app by utilizing external data sources. Additionally, extended the "Enrich account data" AI Skill to improve population of account information using Creatio.ai. Creatio.ai can now retrieve and populate additional parameters on the account page, improving the efficiency and completeness of account profiles.<br>More details<br>The "Enrich account data" AI Skill requires installation of the [Apollo.io connector for Creatio](https://marketplace.creatio.com/node/31135) app. Results retrieved from the **Apollo.io connector for Creatio** app are prioritized over Apollo Info results.<br>- If the **Apollo.io connector for Creatio** app is unavailable, Creatio.ai uses results from the Bing Search web search engine.<br>- If neither are available, Creatio.ai requests the user to provide the Bing Search API key.<br>The response from Creatio.ai specifies the data enrichment source (Apollo or Bing).<br>- Added support for the following account page fields to the "Enrich account data" AI Skill: "Industry," "Also known as," "Annual revenue," "Business entity," "No. of employees," "Contacts," "Primary contact," "Type," "Category," "Addresses."<br>- Added support for conversational input where users can initiate a request like "Find contacts for account X with C-level titles." The "Sales agent" guides the user to refine the query if needed, fetches up to 10 relevant contacts, and checks for duplicates using predefined rules. Only unique contacts are saved to Creatio. A confirmation message informs the user about the number of contacts successfully added and those that already exist in the Creatio instance.<br>Previously, users manually collected and added data related to an account, and Creatio.ai offered limited support for enriching account data. Now, the "Enrich account data" AI Skill extracts enriched data automatically, including industry, revenue, business type, number of employees, country/region, address, communication options, and related contacts that include job titles and communication details. This enhancement ensures the creation of complete account profiles, maintaining up-to-date and data-rich records, improves account and contact management efficiency, helps users keep account data complete and well-structured, reduces manual data entry, minimizes data gaps, and provides more accurate account profiles. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Added a new auxiliary "MatchlIndustriesCollection" AI Skill that compares industry names and determines the "Industry" field value to supplement the improved "Enrich account data" AI Skill. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skill processes | Changed | Added and updated business processes required for working of the improved "Enrich account data" AI Skill.<br>More details<br>- Added the following business processes:<br>  - "Read Account employees number"<br>  - "Read Business Entity"<br>  - "Add contacts to account"<br>  - "Add Primary contact"<br>- Updated the "Update Account Data" business process. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Added auto-applying default access rights for skills and agents if access rights were not defined when configuring skills and agents. The platform validates access rights during installation of a package or app that includes skills and agents. If access rights are not predefined explicitly and the platform has defined default access rights, these rights are automatically applied to the installed skill or agent. The action of auto-applying default access rights is logged. This enhancement improves usability, ensures that newly installed skills are available immediately after installation, and reduces the cost of manual configuration.<br>More details<br>Previously, skills installed without predefined access rights required manual configuration that could lead to unintentional inaccessibility. This update enables the platform to assign default access rights intelligently, ensuring immediate usage of new Creatio.ai features. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Improved the system prompt and the logic for selecting skills and agents in Creatio.ai. The prompt was refined to better follow instructions and block irrelevant or unsupported queries. It responded more accurately to the user's language and context, staying focused on Creatio-related topics. This update ensures that Creatio.ai stays within platform boundaries and delivers more relevant, accurate responses by switching skills and agents dynamically based on context.<br>More details<br>Previously, Creatio.ai could handle out-of-scope requests or choose incorrect skills.<br>Additionally, added a new information block to the prompt to help Creatio.ai understand available skills and agents and switch more accurately between them depending on the conversation context. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Added | Added file processing in Creatio.ai. You can now upload files via button, attach files by dragging, and use files in skills and agents, enriching runtime context and increasing flexibility. This enhancement provides a unified and convenient experience for Creatio.ai interaction with files, aligned with modern usage patterns in enterprise environments.<br>More details<br>Added the following system settings:<br>- "Allowed file extensions" (`CreatioAIAllowedFileExtensions` code). Out of the box, "txt,docx,pdf,htm,css,scss,json,xhtml,md,tex,csv,tsv,log,sql,cs,ts,yaml,yml."<br>- "File extensions AllowList" (`FileExtensionsAllowList` code)<br>- "File extensions DenyList" (`FileExtensionsDenyList` code)<br>Some file types are filtered for security reasons.<br>Files uploaded during a session are stored during the entire interaction and are available for use later. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Added | Implemented restoration of session documents when sessions are reloaded from the database. Users can now access previously attached files even after several days, ensuring continuity and data persistence in Creatio.ai sessions. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Added | Added limits on file uploads to Creatio.ai to enhance performance, consistency, and security. Creatio now limits the size of individual files, the size of session files, and the size of skill and agent attachments.<br>More details<br>Added the following system settings:<br>- "Session file content size limit" (`CreatioAISessionFileContentSizeLimit` code). Out of the box, "60000," in symbols.<br>- "Allowed file extensions" (`CreatioAIAllowedFileExtensions` code). Out of the box, "txt,docx,pdf,htm,css,scss,json,xhtml,md,tex,csv,tsv,log,sql,cs,ts,yaml,yml."<br>- "Character limit for creatio.ai user query" (`CreatioAIMaxUserQueryLength` code). Out of the box, "50000."<br>- "Intent file content size limit" (`CreatioAIIntentFileContentSizeLimit` code). Out of the box, "60000," in symbols.<br>- "Maximum skill/agent file size in MB" (`CreatioAIMaxIntentFileSize` code). Out of the box, "5."<br>- "Maximum session file size, in MB" (`CreatioAIMaxSessionFileSize` code). Out of the box, "5."<br>System settings manage the maximum file size and allowed file types independently for each use case. This ensures that files are handled flexibly and securely aligned with organizational policies.<br>Creatio alerts users when a file exceeds the size limit or has an unsupported type using error messages. The Creatio.ai chat panel displays error messages in line with other Creatio.ai messages. The mini page for skill and agent attachments displays the corresponding error, including the name of the corresponding system setting. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added support for managing multiple simultaneous conversations in the Creatio.ai chat panel. The panel displays a list of recent conversations grouped by topic. Each conversation has an icon that includes agent initials, a chat name generated from the conversation topic, and a preview of the last message. Previously, all messages were part of a single conversation thread. This enhancement improves clarity and context, helping track and navigate ongoing conversations efficiently. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added the ability to mention agents in chat on the Creatio.ai chat panel. This enhancement improves chat interaction by letting users refer to specific agents easily when creating messages.<br>More details<br>To mention an agent:<br>1. Click the "Mention agent" button or type "@."<br>2. Select an agent from the drop-down list based on your business goals. To simplify selection, each agent specified in the drop-down list has a name and description. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Updated the display of incoming messages in chat on the Creatio.ai chat panel to display the sender name clearly. When an agent replies, their current name is used as the sender label. When no agent is assigned, the label displays "Creatio.ai," helping users easily identify who is replying in the conversation. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Updated debugging behavior for the Creatio.ai chat panel to exclude file contents from user-visible session data. Debug messages now display only file metadata, ensuring clarity without exposing file contents in the UI. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added error handling for file uploads to the Creatio.ai chat panel. Errors of file size and file type are now displayed directly in the chat UI, replacing dialog windows for a more consistent and user-friendly experience. Additionally, error messages are eliminated from duplication. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | The Creatio.ai chat panel is now resizable, and the chat UI dynamically adapts to its width. This responsive behavior ensures a smoother experience across desktop and mobile devices.<br>More details<br>When the panel is expanded, a combined view displays both the chat list and the active conversation. The selected conversation is highlighted, enabling seamless switching between chats. Content is displayed in a single view out of the box and on screens that have small width. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Updated the header behavior for Creatio.ai chat panel to support multiple simultaneous conversations.<br>More details<br>- The "Restart Creatio.ai session" button was replaced by the "New chat" button.<br>- You can still access debug information for the current chat using the **Debug info** action in the chat menu. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added a **New chat** button to initiate new conversations directly from the Creatio.ai chat panel. Each new chat is created upon sending the first message and is displayed at the top of the chat list. The chat name is generated from the conversation topic. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added the ability to manage the visibility of the chat list in the Creatio.ai chat panel. When the Creatio.ai chat panel is expanded, the **Chat list** button is displayed to let users focus on a single conversation or manage multiple simultaneous conversations. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved the display of inline images in messages displayed in the Creatio.ai chat panel. Images are now adapted to the size of the message container, ensuring better visual alignment. To view the image in full size, click an image. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Changed | Added auto validation of missing dependencies before installing an app from a file. This enhancement prevents the installation of incomplete apps, improves dependency management clarity, and detects missing components in advance.<br>More details<br>When a user uploads an app file, Creatio checks for all required dependencies. If any are missing, installation is blocked, and the platform displays a dialog window that includes a list of the missing dependencies and the following information:<br>- Dependency type (app or package).<br>- Name of the app or package.<br>- Link to the app page on Creatio Marketplace if available.<br>- Pricing model of the Marketplace app if applicable.<br>A detailed warning message describes the issue. To cancel the installation and remove the uploaded file, click the **Close** button. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Changed | Enhanced the functionality of the minimum required Creatio version for apps. Now the **Required Creatio version** field on the **Dependencies** tab of the **App properties** window in the No-Code Designer lets you specify both a dedicated compatible Creatio version, e. g., 8.3.0, and a range of compatible Creatio versions, e. g., 8.2.1 - 8.3.0. A tooltip includes format requirements for the field value. This enhancement helps prevent app installation on unsupported platform versions, improving compatibility control and deployment reliability. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Changed | Added a loading mask to display progress when loading and checking files while installing an app from a file. Once the user selects a file, the **Select file** button is replaced by the **Loading file** button that is inactive during the download and verification process and informs users of file processing. The enhancement prevents repetitive actions, improving the overall experience before proceeding to the app installation. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Fixed | Fixed the error that prevented transferring an app between environments using the **Deploy** action from the app menu in ALM Portal when the app included an inactive package. The error occurred after the implementation of a separate system operation that lets technical users install and deploy apps. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Fixed | Fixed the error of displaying information related to the previous version of the Marketplace app in the **What's new** field of the Application installation window. |
| Application Hub | App installation,<br>App update | Changed | Added icons that identify the type of installed or updated item (app or package). The **Application update** and **Application installation** windows display icons before the "Name" column. The improvement facilitates quick interpretation of items during the app deployment process. |
| Application Hub | App binding | Changed | Enhanced the **Dependencies** tab of the **App properties** window in the No-Code Designer to support both app and package-level dependencies. If you add a package-level dependency, inherited elements of the package, such as pages, sections, data models, and business processes, are automatically displayed on the corresponding No-Code Designer tabs within the app context. This enhancement lets you inherit certain functionality directly from packages even if they are not bound to the app, improving modular reuse and flexibility in app development.<br>More details<br>When you select a package or app in the "Name" column, Creatio excludes the following packages from the list of available packages: the `Custom` package, previously added packages, and packages of the current app.<br>The "Type" column includes the dependency type, the read-only "Developer" column includes the developer name. |
| Application Hub | App binding | Changed | Improved synchronization of dependency data between apps and packages to ensure consistent visibility of app properties across environments. This improved structure is synchronized during the upload of the app-descriptor.json file, and dependency information is stored in the database after app installation. This ensures that app properties visible in the target environment match properties in the source environment, improving consistency and reliability for no-code development.<br>More details<br>Added the following properties to the `DependsOn` property in the app-descriptor.json file:<br>- `Name` for apps<br>- `UId` and `Name` for packages |
| Application Hub | App templates | Changed | Updated the **Records and business processes** page template. Now, list pages include a new **Dashboards** component. The functionality is managed by the `FreedomUIDashboardsEnabled` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. Previously, the feature was under beta testing.<br>More details<br>The updated template includes the following elements:<br>- the **Toggle panel** component that lets you switch between "List" and "Dashboards" view modes<br>- the **Dashboards** component<br>- the **Filters** component<br>- the **Folders** component<br>Filters and folders are displays dynamically depending on the selected view mode. Since the updated page template can impact heavily customized Freedom UI pages significantly, before updating your production environment, we recommend verifying your customizations on the pre-production environment to ensure compatibility.<br>All necessary page connections are configured automatically to ensure the page uses the same data source as the **Dashboards** component. This facilitates designing more informative and interactive pages without additional setup, streamlining the app development process. |
| Application Hub | Schema inheritance | Changed | Updated the business logic for creating multiple Freedom UI sections based on a single object. Now, only the original section retains its own form page while all additional sections reuse the original form page. This reduces the number of generated schemas and add-ons, ensures consistent behavior across sections, and simplifies configuration and maintenance. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Dashboards | Changed | Added default sizes for components and widgets when dragged to the Freedom UI Designer canvas while editing a dashboard, improving the efficiency of dashboard creation. The default sizes depend on the dragged element type. This update provides a more intuitive and consistent layout, reducing the need to manually resize widgets after they are placed on canvas. This affects dashboards only. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Dashboards | Changed | Added a warning message that alerts users who have access rights to the "Can manage configuration elements" (`CanManageSolution` code) system operation about editing dashboards implemented in the end-user schema. Those messages were enabled only for environments whose "Environment type" (`EnvironmentType` code) system setting is set to "Pre-production" or "Development." This change explicitly notifies users that changes are implemented without package binding and are stored to the package as an end-user schema, not a configuration schema, supporting proper versioning practices during development and maintenance.<br>More details<br>The dashboard implemented in the end-user schema cannot be transferred between environments as part of the package. To migrate the dashboard between environments, add the end-user schema to the package using the **Open as configuration schema** button in the warning message. This provides flexibility for advanced users. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Dashboards | Fixed | Fixed localization of the name of the **Dashboards** parameter block on the Freedom UI Designer setup area in Russian. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Multiple page data sources | Changed | Changed the default value of the `AllowMultipleDataSources` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. The feature manages multiple page data sources on a single page in Freedom UI Designer and correct retrieval of data from these data sources in runtime mode. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Multiple page data sources | Changed | Changed the business logic when adding a new data source to a form page. Now, the following actions are executed:<br>- The Freedom UI Designer setup area for the data source opens automatically.<br>- The criteria of out-of-the-box sorting are applied to achieve consistent behavior in runtime mode. You can remove sorting if needed.<br>- The "Dropdown" type field used in relations is now pre-populated by the default value specified in the **Displayed value** property value in the **Object settings** property block of Object Designer. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Multiple page data sources | Changed | Added support for "many-to-one" relationships between primary and secondary page data sources. You can now add an object that is referenced in the "Lookup" type columns of data source whose **Primary data source** checkbox on Freedom UI Designer setup area is selected as page data source and edit fields related to such data source in runtime.<br>More details<br>If you set the "Lookup → ID" relation in the secondary data source settings, at runtime, data from the data source is loaded each time the field used in the relation is changed. Reloaded data after such change is prioritized over user-made changes in fields associated with the previous value selected in the relation field. The creation of new records in such data sources is limited to minimize the creation of duplicates. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Multiple page data sources | Changed | Added the **Independent data source** checkbox to the Freedom UI Designer setup area for the secondary data source on the form page. When the checkbox is selected, the data source is separated from the main record, loading data based solely on its own filters and sorting conditions. The design-time behavior changes the required settings automatically, and the runtime logic ensures that the data is processed independently.<br>More details<br>The platform loads the same data into the fields associated with that data source consistently, regardless of the primary data source record used to open the form page.<br>- If you change the field values, the corresponding record in the database is updated.<br>- If no record matches the filter criteria, a new record is created automatically when you enter a value in any associated field.<br>- Creatio always tries to load the existing record from data source whose **Independent data source** checkbox on the Freedom UI Designer setup area is selected, even if you are trying to create a new record of data source whose **Primary data source** checkbox is selected. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Sidebars | Changed | Added the **Allow sidebar width adjustment** checkbox to the Freedom UI Designer setup area for sidebars. Out of the box, `false`. The checkbox specifies whether the width of sidebars whose **Location** parameter is empty can be adjusted. The checkbox has a tooltip and is stored in the add-on schema of the sidebar. This provides backward compatibility for existing sidebars. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Sidebars | Changed | Implemented drag resizing of the sidebars to customize the width based on user needs.<br>More details<br>- When the **Allow sidebar adjustment** checkbox on the Freedom UI Designer setup area is selected, users can resize the sidebar to full browser width by dragging its left border. If it reaches the navigation panel, those elements automatically collapse to accommodate the new size.<br>- When the **Allow sidebar adjustment** checkbox on the Freedom UI Designer setup area is cleared, sidebar resizing is disabled.<br>Additionally, the mouse pointer changes to indicate the active drag zone. Sidebar width changes are stored in the user profile. The sidebar reverts to the previously set width only if the user profile does not store information that it was previously opened. Otherwise, the sidebar opens in the stored width. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Sidebars | Changed | Added a **Sidebar mode** button to the `BaseSidebarTemplate` client module schema. The button adjusts the sidebar width in a single click using the predefined "Default," "Expanded," "Fullscreen" modes. The button only has an icon and a tooltip for accessibility. Out of the box, the button is displayed if the **Allow sidebar customization** checkbox on the Freedom UI Designer setup area is selected. Otherwise, the button is hidden. Changes to the sidebar width are saved to and stored in the user profile. The sidebar reverts to the previously set width only if the user profile does not store information that it was previously opened. Otherwise, the sidebar opens in the stored width. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Sidebars | Fixed | Fixed a console error "ERROR TypeError: this.\_appearanceSettingsDefaultLoader.getDefaultAppearanceSettings is not a function" that occurred when configuring the sidebar using the Freedom UI Designer. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Changed | Added support for refreshing multiple page data sources for the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer setup area is set to "Refresh data." Out of the box, the **Data refresh mode** parameter on the Freedom UI Designer setup area is set to "Refresh all" and the button refreshes all page data sources including data sources added after this action is configured. You can exclude some data sources from refreshing if needed. To do this, fill out the **Which data sources to exclude?** parameter. Since dependent data sources and sources created in runtime are always refreshed, they are not displayed in the exclusion list. You can also change the refreshing mode to refresh only specific data sources. To do this, set the **Data refresh mode** parameter on the Freedom UI Designer setup area to "Refresh specific data sources" and fill out the **Which data sources to refresh?** parameter. The enhancement affects existing environments. After Creatio is updated, the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer setup area is set to "Refresh data" refreshes only the specified data sources to ensure backward compatibility.<br>More details<br>The `LoadDataRequest` class is updated as follows:<br>- Added an optional `refreshDataConfig` property. If the property is omitted, the behavior of refreshing data remains the same as before the enhancement.<br>  <br>- Added a new `RefreshMode` enumeration that refreshes all data sources on the page and lets you exclude specific data sources.<br>  - If `refreshDataConfig.mode` is set to `RefreshMode.RefreshAll` and `refreshDataConfig.excludedDataSourceNames` is omitted, all data sources on the page are refreshed.<br>  - If `refreshDataConfig.mode` is set to `RefreshMode.RefreshAll` and `refreshDataConfig.excludedDataSourceNames` is set, all data sources on the page except the specified data sources are refreshed. If the data source depends on the excluded data source, the dependent data source is not refreshed.<br>  - If `refreshDataConfig.mode` is set to `RefreshMode.RefreshSpecific`, the data sources specified in `refreshDataConfig.targetDataSourceNames` are refreshed. Other data sources on the page are not refreshed.<br>- Added a new `RefreshDataConfig` interface that defines the data refresh mode. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Fixed | Fixed the error where opening of Freedom UI Designer setup area for the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter was set to "Refresh data" replaced the button configuration in the source code of the Freedom UI page. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Fixed | Fixed the error of automatic clearing of the **Which list to run process for?** parameter value on Freedom UI Designer setup area for **Button** component after changing the code of a linked list item. This affected a **Button** component whose **Action** parameter is set to "Run process" and **How to run the process?** parameter is set to "For the selected records in list." This fix ensures that the link to the selected list is retained and that the settings of the **Button** component are consistent after changing the list. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Flex column component | Changed | Optimized performance of the **Flex column** component by clearing and disabling the `wrap` property automatically. If you switch the value of the **Direction** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer setup area from "Row" to "Column," the current value of the `wrap` property is automatically cleared and hidden in the Freedom UI Designer setup area to prevent unnecessary rendering logic. Additionally, if you open a Freedom UI Designer setup area for a **Flex column** component whose **Direction** parameter is set to "Column," the `wrap` property value is also cleared automatically. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Timeline component | Changed | Added a tooltip for the **Timeline** component in the Freedom UI Designer. This addition helps users quickly understand the purpose of the component while designing an app. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Timeline component | Changed | Added support for custom quick filters to the **Timeline** component. Creatio lets you customize filters for each tile and use out-of-the-box quick filter options, including filter type, default value, title, hint, icon. Freedom UI Designer displays dedicated area over the tiles of the **Timeline** component to add custom quick filters, and existing filters remain embedded in the **Timeline** component. To set up a quick filter, drag the **Quick** filter component onto the timeline. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed the error where it was impossible to change the data source for the **Timeline** component in the Freedom UI Designer. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Tabs component | Fixed | Fixed the error where specifying the `selectedTab` property for the **Tabs** component in the source code of the Freedom UI page caused the previously selected item, such as the **Save** button, to remain selected visually in the Freedom UI Designer after refreshing the page. This behavior occurred even if a different tab was configured to open. This fix ensures that no element remains visually selected on the canvas after a page refresh, and the specified tab opens correctly in the Freedom UI Designer setup area. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Search component | Fixed | Fixed the error with the **Search** component that generated extra source code when the Freedom UI page was saved. Previously, saving a Freedom UI form page without changes resulted in unnecessary re-saving of the **Search** component, cluttering the source code of the Freedom UI page. Now, only the actual changes are saved, providing cleaner and more efficient source code. |
| Freedom UI Designer | "Dropdown" type field | Changed | Improved performance of the "Dropdown" type field in Freedom UI by optimizing error handling logic. Introduced debouncing for `.setError` execution and adjusted emission to trigger only when the actual error value changes. These enhancements reduce excessive change detection cycles and improve rendering efficiency during user interaction. |
| Freedom UI Designer | "Image" type field | Fixed | Fixed the error where the **Title** parameter value on the Freedom UI Designer setup area was not displayed for the "Image" type field. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Page performance | Fixed | Fixed the error with performance degradation of a Freedom UI page that had a **List** component. Applying multiple quick filters caused reloading of the view model of a Freedom UI page, which in turn created multiple additional view models. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Data encryption | Added | Added support for managing the behavior of encrypted columns in Object Designer and encrypted fields in Freedom UI Designer. These enhancements provide flexible and secure handling of encrypted data in different environments, improving configuration clarity and runtime control.<br>More details<br>- Added configuring permissions for operations on encrypted data using special selectors in Object Designer and Freedom UI Designer. This operation permission determines who has access to the encrypted data and can view the unencrypted value.<br>- Added automatic data encryption. Out of the box, the **Mask displayed value** checkbox is selected in Object Designer for new encrypted columns, providing an initial hiding of sensitive data. If needed, select the **Mask displayed value** checkbox for columns of existing objects in Object Designer.<br>- Added predefined encryption formats to control the visual presentation of encrypted data in Object Designer and Freedom UI Designer while maintaining data security. Available values: "SSN," "SIN," "Bank card," "Hide all characters," "Show only last 4 characters." |
| Freedom UI Designer | Data encryption | Added | Added verification of value visibility for the "Encrypted string" type field in the Freedom UI Designer setup area. The functionality is managed by the `EnableSecureTextMasking` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. If the feature is disabled, the value of the "Encrypted string" type field is hidden, allowing for flexible customization depending on security requirements. |
| Integrations | OAuth authorization | Changed | Added support for the authorization code grant type of OAuth authorization. This enhancement provides access to Creatio data and API directly for integrated apps inside the user context without granting to their credentials for authentication, improving security and transparency, enabling more flexible and user-centric integration scenarios that comply to modern OAuth standards.<br>More details<br>- Added the **Authorized redirect URIs** parameter to configure redirect URIs to receive authorization codes when authorizing an integrated app.<br>- Added the **Application logo** parameter to upload the application logo that is used on the **External applications** tab of the user profile page and on the consent page when integrating an external application.<br>- Added the **Permitted users** parameter to configure Creatio users who are allowed to authorize an integrated app via authorization code grant.<br>- Added the **Monitoring** tab that lets you monitor the list of users who granted access to Creatio data and API from integrated apps.<br>- Added the **External applications** tab on the user profile page to manage a list of external applications that you connected or can connect to your Creatio account by granting access via integration. |
| Integrations | OAuth authorization | Changed | Added the "Grant type" column to the **OAuth integrated applications** page. The column defines the OAuth authorization type. Available values: "On behalf of a user (authorization code)," "Server-to-server (client credentials)." To ensure data consistency and backward compatibility, after Creatio version updates, the column value is populated with "Server-to-server (client credentials)" for all existing OAuth integrations, since authorization code grant was not implemented previously. |
| Integrations | Webhooks | Changed | Added auto-applying changes to the **Webhook entities** lookup. Previously, a new object added to the lookup was applied after 60 minutes. This fix significantly improves user experience and operational efficiency by eliminating unnecessary delays. |
| Integrations | Web services | Changed | Added design-time and runtime support for multi-level `<soap:header>` parameters of SOAP web services. Now, you can select the **SOAP Header** checkbox for a SOAP web service parameter and structure these parameters hierarchically in the **Path to element** field using the `XPath` notation. SOAP headers that have multi-level parameters are handled seamlessly, enabling integration with SOAP WSS-compliant services. |
| Integrations | Web services | Changed | Added support for parsing WSDL files that include custom SOAP headers in the request body of SOAP web services. Now, SOAP headers are correctly recognized and processed according to the defined hierarchy, ensuring more accurate service integration and configuration. |
| Integrations | OData | Fixed | Fixed the error with incorrect license loading using the License manager if the "RAM limit for data selection via OData" (`MaxMemoryUsageToGetDataViaEntityCollection` code) system setting was enabled. The fix eliminates memory usage limitations for certain data types involved in license loading. This prevents interruptions or crashes when accessing license data under memory-limited conditions for OData. |
| Business processes | Call Creatio.ai element | Changed | Updated the icons for the **Call Creatio.ai** business process element to align with the overall Creatio UX, improving visual consistency and user comprehension. |
| Business processes | OAuth authorization | Changed | Disabled automatic background running of the "Creatio OAuth maintenance process" business process that registers a default resource for OAuth authorization. This fix aims to reduce unnecessary consumption of server resources caused by requests to the Identity Service, regardless of OAuth functionality usage.<br>More details<br>Creatio no longer runs the "Creatio OAuth maintenance process" business process every hour. If needed, run the business process manually. |
| Business processes | Processes | Changed | Added the "Check Apollo, Zoominfo available" business process that checks whether ZoomInfo Sales and Apollo.io connectors are installed and merges their responses. |
| Business processes | Process tracing | Changed | Added a `null` check for the input parameter before evaluating its type in the `SetParameterValue` method that is used in `JsonProcessTraceFormatter`. This prevents potential `NullReferenceException` when `null` values are passed. |
| Business processes | DCM case execution | Fixed | Fixed the error where DCM cases were canceled incorrectly after a sub-process was terminated with an error. Even if users tried to manually change the case stage, the DCM case remained in the "Error" stage, causing an auto-cancellation of the case by the archiving mechanism. Now the DCM case stage is updated correctly when the stage is changed manually, preventing unintentional termination. |
| Business process | Translations | Fixed | Fixed stability of the "Apply translations" business process after restarting Creatio instance in .NET 8. The issue occurred when the platform attempted to automatically resume the business process after a scheduled or accidental instance restart, resulting in execution errors. The fix ensures that the process resumes reliably without errors, maintaining the continuity of translation workflows.<br>More details<br>Previously, if the "Apply translations" business process was interrupted due to an instance restart, .NET 8 environments were unable to restart it correctly, resulting in failures in the translation update mechanism. |
| Business rules | Business rule execution | Fixed | Removed redundant console messages during the execution of business rules. |
| Business rules | Business rule execution | Fixed | Fixed the error where business rules did not recognize the same lookup values that differed only in the `primaryColorValue` value. Now, such values are recognized as identical, and the platform compares the values, not JSON objects. |
| Business rules | Business rule execution | Fixed | Fixed the error with the incorrect format of the result returned by the business rule that configured a filter for "Dropdown" type fields. The `GUID` is returned instead of `{GUID}`. This issue affected Creatio deployed on Oracle DBMS only and custom request handlers that rely on values set by business rules. |
| Business rules | Formulas | Fixed | Fixed color of icons for "Currency" type formulas in Formula designer. |
| End user experience | Dashboards | Added | Added ability to manage and set up dashboards for end users.<br>More details<br>Runtime mode:<br>- The end user can add a new dashboard at runtime mode using the following ways:<br>  - From the blank page<br>  - Using the **Add new dashboard** button in the dashboard list<br>- The end user can edit, copy, and delete the dashboard using actions in the dashboard menu.<br>  <br>- The end user can set up access rights and share dashboards with other users using the **Set up access rights** action in the dashboard menu.<br>  <br>- The list of dashboards is filtered depending on access rights for the current user.<br>  <br>- End-user work with the dashboards is managed by licenses and access rights for system operations.<br>  <br>- Dashboards actions are also managed by access rights for the current user.<br>  <br>- End user who creates the dashboard has full access to dashboard management.<br>  <br>Design-time mode:<br>- No-code creator can edit, copy, and delete the dashboard using actions in the dashboard menu.<br>- Set up connections among the section page, the **Dashboards** component and the dashboard in Freedom UI Designer to ensure data filtering at runtime.<br>- Apply filter to a dedicated analytics widget. Out of the box, these fields are populated while dragging.<br>- Access rights to view dashboards are automatically applied to the "All employees" group when the dashboard is created using Freedom UI Designer.<br>- A pre-configured filter is added to the Freedom UI Designer setup area.

This enhancement ensures a more comfortable and efficient user experience on screens that have small sizes, reducing the need for additional gestures or resizing.<br>More details<br>When both the navigation panel and section are hidden, the sidebar automatically expands to full screen on small screens. |
| End user experience | Notifications | Changed | Added browser notifications for Freedom UI functionality for parity with Classic UI. The browser now displays notifications for feed, noteworthy events, business processes, approvals, reminders, and system notifications. This ensures consistent notification behavior for both Freedom UI and Classic UI, enabling users to personalize notification settings according to their needs. Browser notifications are managed by the following checkboxes on the **Notification settings** tab of the user profile page:<br>- Feed browser notifications. Out of the box, selected.<br>- Noteworthy events browser notifications. Out of the box, cleared.<br>- Business process tasks browser notifications. Out of the box, selected.<br>- Approvals browser notifications. Out of the box, selected.<br>- Reminders browser notifications. Out of the box, selected.<br>- System notifications browser notifications. Out of the box, cleared. |
| End user experience | Emails | Fixed | Fixed the error where replying to emails that included images lacking the `src` attribute in the markup caused an error during sending. Creatio now prevents uploading such empty images, ensuring that emails can be sent without interruption. |
| End user experience | Translations | Changed | Added the `SkipActualizeTranslationOnPageLoad` additional feature that manages automatic updating of the **Translation** section content when the section is opened. Out of the box, disabled. Regardless of the feature state, manually edited values (`isChanged=true`) are now saved and not overwritten during the actualization process. This enhancement improves performance when opening the **Translation** section, retains full control over the update run, and protects custom translations from overwriting.<br>More details<br>Previously, the **Translation** section launched the update process on every section load that could slow down access and inadvertently overwrite custom localizable values related to pages and data modified after last update date. |
| End user experience | Summary component | Changed | Added keyboard support for the option menu item of the **Summary** component. You can now press Enter or Space to open the menu item. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Changed | Added support for automatically updating feed messages and files in the timeline. The timeline now displays new feed messages and attachments in real time, without the need to refresh the page. The functionality is managed by the **Enable live data update** checkbox in the **Behavior** property block of Object Designer for the objects used to store feed messages or files. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Changed | Enhanced the **Timeline** component to support colorized fields of the "Dropdown" type. These fields now appear in the timeline with the same colors as on pages and in expanded lists, ensuring visual consistency. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Changed | Added the ability to edit feed messages directly from the timeline using the **Edit** action in the feed message. Upon saving, the edited message is immediately updated in the timeline. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Changed | Improved the display of the "Text" type field whose **Multiline text** checkbox is selected in the Freedom UI Designer setup area to preserve and show line breaks in the timeline. This update enhances readability by ensuring that text formatting remains consistent with the original input. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed the error where heavy emails were not visible in the timeline if they included Base64-encoded images. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed the error where the **Timeline** component failed to load if it included a tile referencing a non-existent object. This fix ensures the timeline now displays records for existing objects without interruption or failure. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | Optimized performance of **List** component data sorting. The more complex the list, the more significant the change. |
| End user experience | List component | Fixed | Fixed minimum target zone of button that edits cell values in the **List** component to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | List settings | Fixed | Fixed the error where unsupported types were displayed in the **What to display** field of the "Dropdown" type when configuring aggregated columns in the **List** component. Only supported types are now available in the **What to display** field of the "Dropdown" type to ensure cleaner and valid configuration options across all environments. |
| End user experience | List settings | Fixed | Fixed the error where localized values of column names were incorrectly displayed in the **List** component for folders that have custom list settings. This fix ensures that localized values of column names are displayed in the **List** component only where they are specified, maintaining the correct separation between default and custom list settings. |
| End user experience | "Dropdown" type field | Changed | Disabled hyperlinks for the list in selection window of "Dropdown" type field to prevent unintended navigation. |
| End user experience | "Dropdown" type field | Fixed | Fixed the issue where pre-selected value in the "Dropdown" type field has incorrect styles after the page saving and reopening that could lead to visual inconsistencies and potential confusion. |
| End user experience | "Phone" type field | Changed | Enhanced the input mask for a "Phone" type field to support countries that have variable-length phone numbers, for example, Indonesian or Italian numbers. When the mask is enabled, users can enter phone numbers that have different lengths within the defined range. Out of the box, Creatio displays the minimum required digits and users can enter additional digits up to a specified maximum limit, ensuring both flexibility and format consistency. |
| End user experience | "Rich text" type field | Fixed | Fixed the error where selecting an oversized inline image triggered unnecessary scrollbars in the "Rich text" type field on both Freedom UI and Classic UI pages. Now, selecting an oversized inline image does not cause extra scrollbars. |
| End user experience | "Rich text" type field | Fixed | Fixed the error where an autogenerated link to highlighted text copied from the browser context menu and inserted into the "Rich text" type field was displayed as invalid. Creatio now correctly recognizes and accepts such links, ensuring proper link insertion functionality. |
| End user experience | Page loading | Changed | Optimized runtime loading of Freedom UI pages opened in background browser tabs. This reduces delays caused by browser tab throttling mechanisms. The improvement affects timer execution mechanism in background tabs. Actual performance gains might vary depending on the browser's background tab behavior.<br>More details<br>The functionality is managed by the `DisableWorkerTimers` additional feature. Out of the box, disabled. If the error of page loading occurs again and you have to change the status of the `DisableWorkerTimers` additional feature, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to implement changes in the platform. |
| End user experience | Page saving | Fixed | Fixed the error that caused user edits to be lost when live data updates occurred during the editing process. The fix ensures that user changes are correctly recognized and saved even if live data updates happen concurrently.<br>More details<br>Previously, if a user modified one or more fields and a live update affected the same page before saving, Creatio incorrectly assumed the user-entered data was unchanged. As a result, these changes were not saved to the database despite being displayed in the UI. In cases where live updates modified only the user-edited fields, the **Save** button did not appear at all, leading to data loss. |
| End user experience | Page copying | Fixed | Fixed the error where a duplicate Freedom UI list page did not open after opening a Classic UI form page from a Freedom UI form page and creating a new linked record on the page. For example, a duplicate **Contacts list page** in Freedom UI did not open after creating a new linked contact through a **Contacts form page** in Classic UI that was launched from a **Leads form page** in Freedom UI. The system now handles transitions between UI types correctly and opens the duplicate page as expected. |
| End user experience | Page closing | Fixed | Fixed inconsistent behavior when closing a page that is configured in Process Designer. |
| End user experience | Page performance | Changed | Improved performance of highly loaded pages that include dashboards and charts. |
| End user experience | Page performance | Changed | Improved performance of value validation and updates in `BaseViewModel` when opening, modifying, or creating records on complex pages.<br>More details<br>The functionality is managed by the `ViewModel.DontDeferUpdatingValueAndValidity` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. If the error of page performance occurs again and you have to change the status of the `ViewModel.DontDeferUpdatingValueAndValidity` additional feature, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to implement changes in the platform. |
| End user experience | App UX | Fixed | Fixed the issue with incorrect display of the logo in new version of the Safari browser. |

| End user experience | App UX | Fixed | Fixed minimum target size for tooltip inside **Inputs** type fields to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | App UX | Fixed | Fixed the error where some icons in metrics were not displayed in runtime mode. This fix ensures that icons added to metrics render correctly during runtime. |
| Advanced customization | Web services | Changed | Unified the response format of the `QuerySchemaProfiles` endpoint. When no data is found, an empty array (`[]`) is returned instead of an empty object (`{}`). |
| Advanced customization | Configuration section | Fixed | Fixed the error where translating object titles in the **Translation** section, such as records that had the `Data:SysSchema.Caption` key type, caused the incorrect labeling of the corresponding objects in the **Configuration** section with the **Need actualization** icon. This unintentional status change broke the accuracy of configuration states. This fix ensures stability of object status and reflects only structural changes, maintaining consistency and preventing redundant operations when deploying or validating a configuration.<br>More details<br>The platform now correctly distinguishes between translation updates and object schema changes. Translating schema titles no longer causes status changes in the **Configuration** section, ensuring that translated objects are not flagged as requiring a database update unless there are actual structural changes. |
| Advanced customization | Object Designer | Fixed | Fixed a culture-specific parsing error in .NET 8 that prevented object opening in RTL localization like Hebrew.<br>More details<br>Updated business logic of number parsing to use `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` parameter, ensuring consistent behavior across all cultures in the **Configuration** section. |
| Advanced customization | Object Designer | Fixed | Fixed the error of saving the "Selection window" value of the **Lookup view** property in Object Designer after publishing an object schema. Since the `IsSimpleLookup` property was incorrectly handled while saving and publishing the object schema, reloading the published schema unintentionally rolled back the value of the **Lookup view** property to the default `List` value. |
| Advanced customization | Page saving | Fixed | Fixed the error of saving Freedom UI pages in Module Designer when the pages have duplicate localizable strings. Now, Module Designer automatically removes duplicates when saving pages avoiding manual cleaning of duplicates. The functionality is managed by the `ClientUnitSchemaDesigner.DisableLocalizableStringDeduplication` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. If the error of saving Freedom UI pages occurs again and you have to change the status of the `ClientUnitSchemaDesigner.DisableLocalizableStringDeduplication` additional feature, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to implement changes in the platform. |
| Advanced customization | Page performance | Changed | Optimized filter building for data sources that have dependencies. |
| Advanced customization | Page performance | Changed | Implemented cancelling of incomplete `EntitySchemaQuery` requests when the user leaves the page. Now, `EntitySchemaQuery` requests are canceled when `ViewModel` or `Model` is destroyed. The functionality is managed by the `DoNotAllowCancelRequest` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled. |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migrated the **Button** component to Angular Material library version 16.<br>More details<br>Internal layout:<br>- Refactored the internal structure of the **Button** component.<br>- Removed the internal Angular Material selector `mat-button-wrapper`.<br>- Added the internal Angular Material class `crt-button-inner-container`.<br>CSS classes: updated some internal Angular Material classes as part of the migration to Material Design Components for the Web. For example, the `mat-flat-button` class is replaced by the `mat-mdc-unelevated-button` class. |
| Advanced customization | System settings | Fixed | Fixed localization of the "Log data expiration period (days)" (`ProcessLogExpirationPeriod` code) system setting in Russian. |
| Advanced customization | jQuery library | Security | Removed deprecated version of `jQuery` library 3.5.1. Now the only available version of the `jQuery` library is 3.7.1. |
| Advanced customization | App UX | Changed | Removed the warning about compilation in .NET 8 when compiling a custom **User task** process element of a business process that has no parameters. |
| Administration | App performance | Changed | Added a mechanism to collect front-end performance metrics as part of ongoing performance monitoring. The functionality is managed by the `EnableClientPerformanceMonitoring` additional feature and uses the existing `creatio.Metrics` infrastructure. Out of the box, disabled.<br>More details<br>- Added a new web service endpoint: `[CreatioURL]/ServiceModel/ClientMetricsService.svc/PublishPerformanceMetrics` to send metrics.<br>- The endpoint usage is managed by the "Can publish performance metrics" (`CanPublishPerformanceMetrics` code) system operation. |
| Administration | App performance | Fixed | Fixed a scenario where the Creatio instance became inoperable for some users when having issues with the IndexedDB database. |
| Administration | Page performance | Fixed | Fixed the error that caused infinite loading of the object permissions list in the **Object permissions (read-only)** expanded list on the technical user page. The error occurred when a large number of objects were assigned to a user that overloaded the UI and prevented consistent data display. The mechanism for loading the object permission list was optimized to handle scenarios with a large number of available objects. The update prevents infinite load states and ensures that data display remains consistent regardless of the number of user-associated objects. |
| Administration | Cache clearance | Added | Added a system page to clear the browser cache. Additionally, the system page enables clearing the cache of the IndexedDB database.<br>More details<br>The system page can be accessed via the `[CreatioURL]/Login/LoginWithoutCache.html` URL. |
| Administration | End-user schemas | Added | Implemented an internal mechanism that stores end-user schemas in the database independently of packages. This enhancement lets users who do not have access rights to the **Configuration** section but have access rights to the end-user schemas execute full-fledged CRUD operations. This solution is currently used in the Freedom UI dashboards. |
| Administration | End-user schemas | Added | Implemented a platform-wide internal permission mechanism applicable to both configuration and end-user schemas. This mechanism manages access to read, edit, and delete operations and supports permission granting. Permissions can be granted using data binding. This solution is currently used in the Freedom UI dashboards. |
| Administration | Passwords | Fixed | Fixed the error that caused password recovery to fail when there was a mismatch between the user's local time zone and the server time zone. The platform incorrectly marked the password recovery link as expired. This fix ensures correct link validation regardless of time zone differences. |
| Administration | Translations | Changed | Prevented the creation of duplicate records in the **Translation** section. This enhancement resolves an issue where incorrect import settings could add multiple records that have the same translation key. This enhancement ensures that keys are unique during record creation, and executes automatic cleanup of duplicates during translation updates.<br>More details<br>Previously, it was possible to accidentally enter duplicate translation keys that resulted in inconsistencies and errors in translation logic. The platform now blocks the creation of new translated records that have existing keys, ensuring that records in the translations section are unique. |
| Administration | Translations | Fixed | Fixed the error where records that had identical localized values in the primary and additional language cultures were mistakenly treated as validation issues. Now, identical localized values are not considered an omitted translation and do not trigger warnings, and records are considered valid. This fix leads to cleaner and more accurate validation results and saves time for users who manage multilingual content. |
| Administration | Translations | Fixed | Fixed the error of ignoring records that included untranslated localizable values with translations specified in the **Translation** section. These records were incorrectly marked as valid. This caused incomplete validation results. Now, the platform detects records that do not have a translation history but have localizable values in the **Translation** section. This fix ensures that all untranslated records are identified, helping to maintain high quality and consistency in multilingual content. |
| Administration | Translations | Fixed | Fixed the error of loading translations of the primary language culture using the `LoadWorkspaceContent` operation of the WorkspaceConsole utility. This issue affected the ability to populate or update English translations using WorkspaceConsole utility. The fix ensures that translations of the primary language culture are loaded and applied along with other localized content, maintaining consistency across language cultures and simplifying content migration tasks. |
| Administration | File storages | Changed | Added support for an optional `RegionName` parameter that explicitly specifies the AWS S3 region in the connection string used for file storage integration. This enhancement improves compatibility with AWS region policies, provides better control over multi-region deployments, and improves reliability when connecting to AWS S3 buckets hosted in region-aware configurations, which in turn avoids connectivity issues and authorization errors due to incorrect or lacking region information in AWS S3 requests.<br>More details<br>Previously, AWS S3 connections used common settings out of the box that could result in failed interactions with buckets hosted in specific AWS regions. |
| Administration | OAuth authorization | Changed | Deprecated the `EnableFreedomUIOAuthSection` additional feature that managed the switching of the **OAuth integrated applications** page between Classic UI and Freedom UI. The **OAuth integrated applications** page is now only available in the Freedom UI. This improves overall consistency, ensures modern, supported, and unified UX. |
| Administration | Configuration section | Changed | Implemented validation to prevent the creation, installation, or import of schemas whose codes differ only by case. This enhancement eliminates a set of errors encountered during the generation of static content, particularly on file systems where file names are not case-sensitive. |

## Creatio products and apps [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-products-and-apps "Direct link to Creatio products and apps")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer 360 | Contact saving | Fixed | Fixed the error of creating a contact from the **Primary contact** field on the account page, then cancelling and retrying the action, resulted in the entered value not appearing in the new contact's profile. Data is now saved consistently and displayed as expected. |
| Creatio Marketing | Workplace setup | Changed | Replaced the **Emails** Classic UI section with the **Bulk emails** Freedom UI section in the "Marketing" workplace for new environments to improve the structure and grouping of related marketing tools. Existing environments remain unchanged. You can still add the **Emails** section to the workspace if needed. |
| Creatio Marketing | Email settings page UI | Changed | The **API key** field value on the **Email settings** page is now masked in the UI to improve system security and eliminate the possibility of unauthorized viewing, copying or editing of the Api key directly from the UI, reducing the risk of accidental data leakage.<br>More details<br>- Disabled the **Copy to clipboard** action for the **API key** field value.<br>- Enabled the read-only mode for the **API key** field value to prevent manual editing. |
| Email marketing | Bulk emails | Changed | Added a warning mini page that alerts users about the limits of email sending on trial Creatio versions. Creatio displays a mini page when a user selects an audience that exceeds the specified daily sending limit. The changes are applied only for trial environments. |
| Email marketing | Bulk emails (Classic UI) | Fixed | Configuration of split tests is no longer copied when duplicating bulk emails in Classic UI. |
| Email marketing | Content Designer (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed the error where Content Designer (Classic UI) did not save content entered via the HTML editor in text content blocks. The preview and saved versions previously displayed outdated content, leading to inconsistencies and editing confusion.<br>More details<br>Fixed the mechanism that saves text content blocks edited using the HTML editor in the Email Designer to ensure changes are saved and displayed correctly. Now, updates are saved accurately and displayed instantly in the preview, improving editing reliability and user confidence when working with custom HTML in email templates. Previously, the changes were not applied and preview displayed outdated content. |
| Email marketing | Marketing campaigns | Fixed | Fixed the error of copying campaigns that had bulk emails created using Email Designer. Previously, these emails were not duplicated. This restricted reuse of campaigns that depend on new designer-based content. |
| Lead Generation | Facebook forms | Changed | Supported the transfer of consent checkbox status specified in Facebook lead generation forms. Now, consent checkbox status is stored in the "Notes" (`Notes` code) column of the "Submitted form" (`FormSubmit` code) and "Lead" (`Lead` code) objects, depending on the Facebook form type used in Creatio. The enhancement applies to all existing environments and remains effective after Creatio version is updated.<br>More details<br>If the consent checkbox in Facebook form settings is cleared, consent data is not displayed. If a Facebook form includes multiple consent checkboxes, the values of all of them are captured and added to the "Notes" (`Notes` code) column. |
| Order and Contract Management | Business processes | Fixed | Fixed the formulas to calculate the **Tax amount** and **Tax amount, base currency** field values in the "Calculate total in order product" business process to align the values with industry standards. The fix applies to both system base currency and order product currency calculations, ensures consistency in all scenarios, improves the accuracy of financial documents by eliminating inconsistencies where tax and total were calculated incorrectly. The updated values are still displayed on the invoice page on the **Products** expanded list of the **General information** tab.<br>More details<br>The updated formula is as follows: `(([#Amount of order product#]-[#Discount amount of order product#])*[#Read tax sub.First item of resulting collection.Rate, %#] ) / 100`. |
| Marketing campaigns | Campaigns | Fixed | Fixed the error where the campaign start date validation failed when the time zone specified in the user profile and local time zone specified in the browser were different.<br>More details<br>The logic now consistently validates against the correct time zone context. Previously, if the time zone specified in the user profile had a smaller UTC offset than the browser, a validation error incorrectly appeared indicating the start date was in the past. This occurred even when selecting the current date and time. |
| Marketing campaigns | Campaigns | Fixed | Fixed the error where campaign participants could hang indefinitely when a trigger fragment failed during execution. This occurred when Creatio failed to mark participants as ready for synchronization, resulting in sessions that exceeded the expected campaign launch period. This enhancement increases the robustness of campaign execution and improves consistency in participant handling.<br>More details<br>Added a mechanism that detects and recovers participants affected by failed trigger runs. Creatio now sets the `IsReadyToSync` flag for such participants prior to the synchronization with the main campaign table to ensure they are included in the standard synchronization flow.<br>Previously, failed trigger executions could leave participants in a stuck state, prolonging session duration and preventing synchronization. |
| Marketing events | Events page (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed a browser console error that occurred when opening the **Events** page via the URL `/0/Shell/#SectionModuleV2/EventPageV2` in Classic UI. The issue was caused by the incorrect handling of the audience spinner component. The loading mask was removed, resolving the console error and ensuring stable page loading. |

## Beta testing of new features [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-twin-changelog\#title-beta-testing-of-new-features "Direct link to Beta testing of new features")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| End user experience | Progress bar | Changed | Enhanced the functionality of working with grouped case stages. You can now customize the retention period for the values of previous case stages. The functionality is managed by the following settings:<br>- `EnableHistoryDCM` additional feature. Out of the box, disabled.<br>- `ProcessFeatures.UseDcmExpirationPeriod` additional feature. Out of the box, disabled.<br>- "DCM log data expiration period (days)" (`DcmLogExpirationPeriod` code) system setting. Out of the box, "60." To avoid limiting the retention period for the values of previous case stages, set the **Default value** field to "-1." |
| End user experience | Button component | Changed | Changed behavior of the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer setup area is set to "Close page" when the action is executed immediately after the user logs into Creatio. Previously, the redirect behavior was inconsistent and could lead to navigating outside the instance or to an unintended blank state. Now, the user is redirected to the Creatio desktop page if the previous browser page is not a Creatio page. The functionality is managed by the `EnableNavigationToDesktopBeforeQuit` additional feature. Out of the box, disabled. |
| Advanced customization | Files | Changed | Implemented native `FileAPI` .NET classes library to replace the external `FileAPI` library. The updated library maintains full compatibility by repeating the same methods and parameters of the external library. The functionality is managed by the `UseExternalFileApiClientLibrary` additional feature. Out of the box, enabled for a closed test group. |
