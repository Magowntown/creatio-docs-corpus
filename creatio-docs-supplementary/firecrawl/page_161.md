At Creatio, we are committed to empowering our customers with industry-leading product innovations for workflow automation, no-code development, and modern CRM. Today we are advancing new forms of innovation with Creatio version 8.2.3 "Energy," featuring the **following new capabilities and enhancements**.

A comprehensive overview of technical changes and enhancements can be found in the [8.2.3 Energy changelog](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-2-3-energy-changelog).

The update guide for the on-site applications is available in a separate [article](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2495).

## Creatio products and apps [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/8-2-3-energy-release-notes\#title-2782-1 "Direct link to Creatio products and apps")

### Email Marketing [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/8-2-3-energy-release-notes\#title-2782-119 "Direct link to Email Marketing")

**Multilingual emails**. You can now communicate with your global audience from a single email more effectively by using multilingual emails. Create multilingual email templates by adding subject lines and content in multiple languages within a single template. Creatio will send emails in the preferred language of each contact automatically. If a contact does not have a preferred language, the email will be delivered in the default language of the campaign.

### Lead Generation [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/8-2-3-energy-release-notes\#title-2782-122 "Direct link to Lead Generation")

**Publish landing pages**. You can now publish pages created in the Landing Page Designer to a URL automatically generated by Creatio. Any design changes can be pushed to the published page without limitations. If you no longer need the landing page, you can unpublish it.

**Import webhooks into any entity**. You can now connect a web form available in the Landing Page Designer to any entity, including custom entities. To do this, add an object to the **Webhook entities** lookup and select it as a source for the web form in the Landing Page Designer.

**Save rows**. You can now reuse content and boost creation efficiency by saving specific row layouts in the Landing Page Designer. Organize the saved rows using custom categories, easily filter and search them, and access them from the **Rows** panel.

**Improved lead tracking**. You can now improve lead quality and streamline reporting by using new tracking capabilities within **Submitted form** and **Lead** records that provide clear insights into lead origins up to the exact landing page designed using the new Creatio Landing Page Designer. It is possible to do the following:

- View the landing page, its URL, and referrer URL directly in the **Submitted form** or **Lead** records.
- Filter submitted forms or leads by landing page to measure performance and refine strategies.
- Capture landing page, its url, and referrer URL data automatically when a new lead or submitted form is created from the landing page.

### Knowledge Management [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/8-2-3-energy-release-notes\#title-2782-120 "Direct link to Knowledge Management")

**Embedded videos**. You can now add videos to and play them directly from knowledge base articles. Add a video by linking to external sources, inserting embedded code, or uploading videos from a local machine.

**Process execution security**. The security and maintainability of the process execution framework was increased by addressing unsafe deserialization practices in Terrasoft.Common.JsonDataReader. This update also includes the deprecation of legacy methods and the introduction of safer defaults across all customer environments.

**Process initiation via SDK**. You can now initiate `ProcessEngineService` from the `@creatio-devkit/common` library reliably. This ensures accurate context transfer, enabling more stable and predictable execution of business logic during automation and development. Learn more: [Interact with business processes using a request handler](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15186).

**Validate translations**. You can now use a business process that validates translations. The process compares data from the **Translation** section and the UI. Once the validation is complete, Creatio provides a high-level summary via a notification in the communication panel. Click the link in the notification to view a detailed report.

**Check on translation application**. Translation application action now checks whether translations in the UI and **Translation** section are consistent before deciding which records to apply. After the process is finished, you receive a notification about whether the translation was applied successfully or any records were not applied. Validation is skipped if you use the "Force apply all translations" option. If you execute the application action for a single culture, Creatio limits the validation process to that culture only.

**Translation update performance**. The translation application process now uses up to 40% less database server CPU performance and the overall speed is up to 11 times faster.

**PFX generation for Windows Server 2016**. The script that generates PFX certificates is now fully compatible with Windows Server 2016.

**Log object runtime metadata re-generation events**. You can now enable or disable logging of metadata re-generation events in the UI. Logging is enabled out of the box. Manage logging in the "Log operations with runtime metadata of entity schema" (`UseRuntimeMetadataOfEntitySchemaLog` code) [system setting](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=269).

**Cache performance for .NET 8 and .NET Framework**. Cache performance on .NET 8 and .NET Framework was optimized.
