## Creatio platform [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-1-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-platform "Direct link to Creatio platform")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents | Changed | Added a new **Analytics Agent** AI Agent that generates dashboard widgets based on natural-language prompts, reducing the need to know where data is stored, how objects are related, or which widget parameters to configure. The created widget is displayed directly in the Creatio.ai chat panel. The agent supports fully configured metric, doughnut, bar, column, area, spline, line, scatter widgets, filters, `count`, `sum`, `average`, `min`, `max` aggregation functions, and forward/backward references to related database tables. This simplifies dashboard creation, reduces manual setup, and makes analytics more accessible. Agent-created widgets are adapted to screen resolution.<br>More details<br>Added a new **Create dashboard** item to the **Actions** menu for the agent-created widget. The menu item opens the Dashboard Designer that includes the widget. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents | Changed | Added the **Permissions to execute** expanded list to manage access rights for agents. Previously, users could interact with agents without grained restrictions. Now, administrators can control who can view, invoke, and use specific agents in the Creatio.ai chat panel. If a user has agent access but lacks rights to one of the agent's skills, that skill remains unavailable. Revoking agent access removes access to the agent and its Skills. Out of the box, access to newly created and existing agents is granted for "All employees" role preserving continuity until permissions are reconfigured. Automatic transfer of AI actions occurs only between agents available to the current user. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Added the **Available in agents** tab to the skill page. The tab displays a list of agents to which the skill is linked and is available to users who can edit skills. This change enables linking a skill with one or more agents directly from the skill page during its creation or editing, simplifying configuration without extra navigation. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Improved API skills to always return structured JSON output. This change gives consistent control over responses and prevents unexpected changes to parameter names by the LLM. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Added support for source code actions in AI Skill workflows, enabling execution of custom C# code within the Creatio.ai pipeline. Additionally, introduced feature toggle functionality that lets individual source code actions be enabled or disabled via metadata. Disabled actions are safely skipped during execution and logged for traceability, providing flexibility in managing unstable or experimental actions. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Added functionality to reference JSON schemas in API skills. The output can now be defined either by output parameters or a referenced JSON schema, ensuring consistent and structured responses. Setup is available through metadata adjustments only. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Changed | Improved the "Summarize case" AI Skill to enhance recognition and relevance of free-text user requests. This change ensures that summaries are actionable, concise, and tailored for support agents, CSMs, and managers.<br>More details<br>- Updated the skill description and matching logic to support multilingual input and free-text patterns.<br>- Improved the output format by removing rigid structural constraints and increasing the level of detail.<br>The new output provides clearer context on technical issues, ownership, blockers, and resolution paths, while adapting tone and content based on the reader role. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Fixed | Fixed the population of the `Apollo account Id` parameter for working of the "Enrich account data" AI Skill to ensure correct data population. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Fixed | Fixed an issue where input parameters for API skills were not saved in the Process Designer. Parameters now persist correctly after saving and reloading the page. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skills | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Cancel** button on the new skill creation page did not close the page. The button now closes the page correctly, and navigation behavior is restored without a persistent loading mask. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Added the `GenAIFeatures.MultiLlmSupport` additional feature that controls availability of functionality for managing multiple AI models. Out of the box, "true," which provides access to the new "LLM Model" (`LlmModel` code), "LLM Model Category" (`LlmModelCategory` code), "LLM Provider" (`LlmProvider` code) objects, as well as the new **Model** field on agent and skill pages. This change provides more flexibility and prepares the platform for supporting multiple Creatio-hosted AI models. Previously, the platform used a single AI model without the ability to switch.<br>More details<br>- Added the "LLM Model" (`LlmModel` code) object that stores information about available AI models.<br>- Added the "LLM Model Category" (`LlmModelCategory` code) and "LLM Provider" (`LlmProvider` code) objects that organize and group AI models.<br>- Added the **Model** field that selects a model to agent and skill pages. The field is linked to the "LLM Model" (`LlmModel` code) object. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Changed the default value of the "Max function calling count per Creatio.ai request" (`MaxFunctionCallingCountPerCopilotRequest` code) system setting from "15" to "25." This setting defines the limit of function-calling orchestrator calls per single LLM request for agents and skills that rely on function calling. This change improves stability and enables successful execution of more complex multi-step agents and skills without reaching the system setting limit. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Security | Restricted DataService and OData access to the "Schema operation right" (`SysSchemaOperationRight` code) and "Default schema operation right" (`SysSchemaDefOperationRight` code) objects. You can now manage access rights for skills and agents only in the UI, preventing unauthorized direct changes. This change improves security and ensures safe configuration of access rights for skills and agents. |
| Creatio.ai | AI Skill processes | Changed | Changed the **Maximum execution time, in seconds** parameter for the "Gemini search" business process from 60 to 120 seconds. The process is required for the "Enrich account data" AI Skill. The update improves stability during lengthy news searches by addressing delays caused by extended response times. |
| Creatio.ai | Google Search API | Added | Added integration with the Google Search API to replace Bing-based enrichment and search features. The update ensures continuity of data enrichment and insights in **Customer 360** app, including account enrichment, contact search, news, and account profiling.<br>More details<br>- Added the `CrtGeminiApiIntegration` package for Google Search API integration.<br>- Added the "Gemini API key" (`GeminiApiKey` code) system setting to store the API key.<br>- Added the "Account news and insights" AI Skill to retrieve insights for the current account from Google Search (available via the "Sales agent").<br>- Added the "Account profiling" AI Skill to analyze the current account using Google Search (available via the "Sales agent"). |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added AI-powered data model understanding in the Creatio.ai chat panel, enabling natural-language questions about the platform data structure. Both end-users and skills/agents can access this knowledge to explain the model and automate tasks.<br>More details<br>- **Chat questions about the data model**. Users can ask where specific data is stored, what a field means, or how tables connect.<br>- **Rich metadata awareness**. The AI understands database tables and column titles as well as descriptions.<br>- **Relationship reasoning**. Follows direct table relationships (column-to-column links) to explain how objects connect.<br>- **Lookup value search**. Finds lookup values and returns both the display value and the internal ID for precise filters and automations.<br>- **Vector-powered understanding**. A semantic index boosts natural-language queries across titles and descriptions. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added automatic start of a new Creatio.ai chat session after login. This change enables immediate interaction while preserving access to previous chats in the chat list. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved RTL language support in the Creatio.ai chat panel. Previously, when using RTL languages such as Arabic, several visual elements in the chat list were displayed incorrectly. These elements are now fully adapted for RTL layouts, ensuring consistent and properly aligned user experience. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added search functionality to the Creatio.ai chat panel.<br>More details<br>Added a search field above the chat list, allowing users to filter chats by name and by the first 500 characters of message content.<br>To search, enter a phrase and press Enter. Matching chats are displayed with highlighted terms in both the chat name and the message preview. Previews are trimmed with ellipses to ensure the matched text is always visible. When opening a chat from the search results, the chat scrolls to the relevant message directly. This change enables faster navigation and easier retrieval of relevant chats. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added chat renaming functionality in the Creatio.ai chat panel. This change helps manage and revisit chats over time.<br>More details<br>You can now rename a chat from the chat list or from within an open chat via the **Actions** menu, available on pointing or keyboard focus for saved chats. The rename dialog window sanitizes current chat name automatically and enforces a minimum of one non-space character for new chat name. Upon confirmation, the new name appears in both the chat list and the chat header immediately. The rename option is hidden for unsaved "New chat" sessions. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added the display of dates to the Creatio.ai chat panel for chats that occurred before the current day, helping users better track the timing of past interactions. The date and time format is adjusted based on the user settings automatically, ensuring clarity and consistency.<br>More details<br>- For the last message sent today, Creatio.ai chat panel displays the time only.<br>- For earlier chats, Creatio.ai chat panel displays the full date. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved error handling in chats when users lack access rights to an agent. The platform now displays a user-friendly error message instead of a technical error. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved message preview logic of the chat list in the Creatio.ai chat panel. This change enhances usability by providing users with a quick overview of recent chat activity directly from the chat list.<br>More details<br>In the chat list, the last message now displays contextual prefixes:<br>- "Draft: " if the message is a draft<br>- "You: " if it is an outgoing message |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved behavior of the Creatio.ai chat panel. Now, when opening a chat that has a draft message, the cursor is placed at the end of the draft text automatically. This change helps users to continue typing immediately without extra clicks or actions. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Implemented scroll position persistence in chats on the Creatio.ai chat panel. The scroll state is now retained when reopening the panel or switching between chats, improving usability in long or active conversations. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved the typing indicator in the Creatio.ai chat panel to support multiple chat sessions. The animation now appears only in active chat where Creatio.ai is generating a response, ensuring accurate visual feedback when switching between chats and improving clarity in multi-chat scenarios. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved accessibility of the chats in the Creatio.ai chat panel to comply with WCAG 4.1.2. All interactive elements, including chat list, chat tiles, input fields, and buttons, now expose correct names, roles, and values for assistive technologies. The screen reader now announces chat list, messages, input fields, and action buttons, ensuring seamless interaction with chats for users that have visual impairments. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved accessibility of message status in the Creatio.ai chat panel to comply with WCAG 4.1.3. The screen reader now announces key chat updates, including new incoming messages, typing indicators, sent confirmations, chat renames, and newly created chats. This change ensures that users who use assistive technologies are kept informed of important status changes without shifting focus, providing a more inclusive and accessible chat experience. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added a skeleton loader for chats in the Creatio.ai chat panel. The loader appears when switching between chats in combined view or when opening a chat from the list, providing a clear visual indicator while messages are loading. This change improves the user experience by signaling loading progress during chat transitions. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Implemented pagination in the chat view on the Creatio.ai chat panel to enable efficient navigation through long message histories. When the number of messages exceeds the set limit, previous or next batches of messages are loaded automatically while scrolling the conversation. Message order is preserved, ensuring continuity, a smooth user experience, and efficient performance without impact on system speed. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed the incorrect behavior of the scroll button in the Creatio.ai chat panel.<br>More details<br>Previously, the unread message counter included outgoing messages incorrectly, and the scroll button always scrolled to the top of the last message, regardless of its read status. Now, the counter displays incoming unread messages only. If the Creatio.ai chat panel has unread messages, the scroll button scrolls to the first unread message. Otherwise, the scroll button scrolls to the bottom of the chat. The scroll button remains visible until the user reaches the bottom. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Removed redundant service requests in the Creatio.ai chat panel left over from the earlier single-session chat implementation. This change improves performance and reduces platform load. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed an issue that caused an endless loading mask when opening a Creatio.ai chat session that has an invalid or missing session ID.<br>More details<br>Implemented a fallback mechanism to automatically start a new chat session if the requested session cannot be opened.<br>Previously, attempting to open a deleted or invalid chat session resulted in an endless loading mask, preventing users from continuing. Now, Creatio detects invalid session IDs and seamlessly opens a new chat instead, improving error handling, preventing UI freezes, and ensuring uninterrupted access to chat functionality. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed an issue that caused long chat names in the Creatio.ai chat panel to wrap to a new line incorrectly. Now, chat names are displayed in a single line next to the **Back** button and are truncated with an ellipsis if they exceed the available space. |
| Creatio.ai | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed the issue where draft messages in new chat were lost when switching the Creatio.ai chat panel between default and expanded modes.<br>More details<br>Previously, switching views reset the message composer, clearing any unsent text. Now, the draft message is preserved during panel resizing, ensuring message continuity and preventing accidental text loss. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Changed | Added support for handling files in the Creatio.ai chat panel through prompt-based references. You can now reference files by name, related record, or business context, with automatic inclusion into the chat session. File constraints and prompts are validated automatically for clarification if multiple matches are found. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Changed | Added support for handling files in business processes required for AI Skills. You can now pass files between process elements, enabling advanced file processing in automation scenarios. The process log records handled files and reports errors if file operations fail. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Changed | Added support for handling files from the opened page context in the Creatio.ai chat panel. When a chat starts with referencing a record, the agent can access and work with files already attached to that record. You can reference these files by name for analysis or actions without re-uploading them. File type, size, and content are validated automatically. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Changed | Added business logic that restores documents linked to skills or agents when a session is reloaded from the database. Linked documents are now preserved and reattached after session recovery, ensuring consistent access even after cache resets or a Creatio restart. |
| Creatio.ai | File processing | Fixed | Fixed an issue where uploaded files in the Creatio.ai chat panel disappeared after going away and returning to the chat. Files now remain visible and accessible when reopening existing chat sessions. |
| Application Hub | App creation | Changed | Added extra validation before starting app creation in Application Hub. Now, a new app cannot be created until the OData library from a previous app creation is built. If the build is still in progress, Creatio notifies the user and asks to wait until it completes. |
| Application Hub | App binding | Changed | Added the `Version` property to the `DependsOn` section in the "app-descriptor.json" file. The property value is now validated before app installation to ensure compatibility. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Changed | Added validation of Marketplace app properties before installation. Creatio now reads the "app-descriptor.json" file from the Marketplace endpoint before installation and validates required app dependencies and the compatible platform version.<br>More details<br>- If the "app-descriptor.json" file does not include the `DependsOn` section, only the compatible version is validated.<br>- If the "app-descriptor.json" file does not include both the `DependsOn` section and the `RequiredPlatformVersion` property, the installation proceeds without validation, and app information is displayed as is.<br>- If both the compatible version and dependencies are invalid, only the compatibility issue is displayed.<br>For single app installations, validation results are displayed in fields.<br>For bundle installations, validation results are displayed in a grid. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Changed | Added functionality to specify the minimum required version of a dependent app in the app properties before exporting the app. This value is stored in the new `Version` property in the **DependsOn** section of the "app-descriptor.json" file. During installation, the specified version is compared with the version of already installed apps. If the installed version does not meet the requirement, the installation is blocked. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Fixed | Fixed an issue where an empty value in the **Required Creatio version** field on the **Dependencies** tab of the **App properties** window in the No-Code Designer blocked app installation. |
| Application Hub | Package installation | Changed | Improved the data installation process to ensure that data bindings are installed correctly even when they reference language cultures that are not present in the Creatio instance. Such data is skipped during installation. |
| Application Hub | Package installation | Changed | Added validation for package installation. Creatio now checks whether all required packages are present in the environment before installation. If dependencies are missing, the **Missing required dependencies** window is displayed, and installation cannot start until the required packages are installed. |
| Application Hub | Page opening | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Run app** button in the No-Code Designer opened an incorrect URL for form pages that have DCM configured. |
| Application Hub | UX | Changed | Added new `/hub` and `/apps` URL slugs to open the Application Hub directly from the browser address bar. |
| Application Hub | UX | Changed | Added a combined validation message for platform and dependency issues. If an app is invalid due to both an unsupported platform version and missing or incompatible app/package dependencies, a single message that includes both types of issues is displayed. |
| Application Hub | UX | Changed | Modified the message displayed when missing dependencies are detected during package or app installation to improve clarity. |
| Application Hub | UX | Changed | Changed the default value of the **Show inherited elements** checkbox for all tabs in the No-Code Designer. Out of the box, cleared. |
| Application Hub | UX | Changed | Renamed the **Version** field to **Application version** and moved it from the **General** tab to the new **Version** tab in the **App properties** window of the No-Code Designer. |
| Application Hub | UX | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the header in the ALM Portal was duplicated after clicking the **Cancel** button in the app installation window that was opened via the **Update** button. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Setup area | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Data source** parameter was not cleared in the Freedom UI Designer when when binding input to data source. Previously, when adding multiple inputs of the same type subsequently, newly added inputs inherited the value of the **Data source** parameter from the previously added input, leading to incorrect data mapping. Now, each newly added input starts with a clean data source state, preventing unintended data propagation. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Widgets | Changed | Added a new **Title** parameter for widgets in the Freedom UI Designer. This change lets you modify widget titles directly from the setup area without opening the **Chart setup** window. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Changed | Added a new "Merge data" action to the **Action** parameter of the **Button** component in the Freedom UI Designer. This action lets you merge records manually directly from the UI in section lists, list widgets, and galleries. The feature ensures parity with Classic UI functionality while supporting Freedom UI design-time configuration and runtime execution. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Changed | Added a new "Follow/Unfollow Feed" action to the **Action** parameter of the **Button** component in the Freedom UI Designer. The action lets you bind a button to a **Feed** component to manage subscriptions. At runtime, if the user is already subscribed, the button changes to **Unfollow Feed**, reflecting the status. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Button component | Changed | Added a new **Reload saved record** checkbox for the **Button** component when the **Action** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer is set to "Save data" and the **Stay on page after record is created** checkbox is selected. This checkbox reloads the saved record from the server to immediately reflect server-side changes incompatible with the new Freedom UI approaches, e.g., legacy autonumbering mechanisms. It is not required when using the **Autonumber** field.<br>More details<br>Previously, when adding a record on the page whose button configuration has **Stay on page after record is created** checkbox selected, and the process of this saving was handled by some server (embedded process) logic, its result was not displayed after the record is saved. Use the **Reload saved record** checkbox only when necessary, as it increases the number of server requests after saving. |
| Freedom UI Designer | List widget component | Added | Added a new **List widget** component to the Freedom UI Designer and Dashboard Designer element libraries. This component combines a fully functional **List** component with a customizable colored frame, ensuring visual consistency when placed alongside other analytics widgets. The **Style** parameter supports the following values: "Fully colored," "Plain white," "Partially colored." Default value: "Plain white." By default, the list inside the widget is non-editable and the **Multiselect** checkbox is cleared. You can change these settings if needed. |
| Freedom UI Designer | List component,<br>List widget component | Changed | Improved the configuration experience for **List** and **List widget** components by redesigning the **Appearance** block on the Freedom UI Designer. The new layout provides clearer visual hierarchy and grouped settings for better usability.<br>More details<br>Added the **List header** checkbox to the **Appearance** block on the Freedom UI Designer for **List** and **List widget** components. Out of the box, selected. When selected, Creatio displays additional checkboxes: **Draggable columns**, **Resizable columns**, **Sorting**. Out of the box, all selected. |
| Freedom UI Designer | List component,<br>List widget component | Changed | Added a new **Limit number of rows** parameter to the **Appearance** block in the Freedom UI Designer for **List** and **List widget** components. This parameter lets you set the maximum number of records to display, e.g., Top 5. When a limit is set, the **Select all** option is disabled. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Folder management menu component | Changed | Removed the unsupported "Extra small" value from the **Border radius** parameter of the **Folder management menu** component in the Freedom UI Designer. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Multiselect lookup component | Changed | Added the **Apply filter by page data** parameter to the Freedom UI Designer for the **Multiselect lookup** component. This change enables configuration of static filters that let you define item selection constraints directly in the component. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Calendar component | Fixed | Fixed an issue that prevented changing the static filter for the **Calendar** component. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Toggle panel component | Changed | Added functionality to set a default tab in the `TabContainer` container of the **Toggle panel** component using the **Default tab** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer. This change provides greater control over the initial display behavior.<br>More details<br>- If the **Toggle view mode** parameter is set to "Button," the **Default tab** parameter is set to the first container tab.<br>- If the **Toggle view mode** parameter is set to "Dropdown," the **Default tab** parameter is marked as required and the parameter value is cleared.<br>When the Freedom UI Designer is opened, the container uses the default tab to determine whether the container body must be visible or collapsed. If no default tab is set, the container appears closed. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Toggle panel component | Changed | Added support for showing and hiding dedicated tabs in the `TabContainer` container of the **Toggle panel** component on Freedom UI pages using business rules. The tabs are classified as layout elements. This change enables more dynamic and personalized UI behavior. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Tabs component,<br>Toggle panel component | Changed | Added **Move up** and **Move down** options to the action menu of each tab in the **Tabs** and **Toggle panel** components in the Freedom UI Designer to streamline reordering. Users can now change the tab order without deleting and re-adding tabs. |
| Freedom UI Designer | Toggle panel component | Fixed | Fixed the console error "Uncaught TypeError: component.items?.map is not a function" that occurred when placing the `TabContainer` of the **Toggle panel** component directly inside a tab content area without other elements. Previously, this caused the container to remain hidden at runtime. |
| Freedom UI Designer | "Dropdown" type field | Changed | Added the **Sort by column** parameter for the "Dropdown" type field in the Freedom UI Designer. This parameter lets you select a lookup column to sort values in ascending or descending order. |
| Freedom UI Designer | "Encrypted string" type field | Changed | Added the **Read-only** checkbox for the "Encrypted string" type field in the Freedom UI Designer. The parameter determines whether the field is editable on the page, aligning its behavior with other fields. |
| Freedom UI Designer | "Encrypted string" type field | Changed | Added support for forward object references in the "Encrypted string" type fields, ensuring they function correctly across relational structures. |
| Freedom UI Designer,<br>Dashboard Designer | Metric widget | Changed | Added the **Hide title** checkbox for the metrics in the Freedom UI Designer and Dashboard Designer. |
| Integrations | OAuth authorization | Fixed | Fixed an issue affecting redirect behavior during the registration of integrations with authorization code grant in Classic UI. Previously, after entering and saving basic integration parameters in the window, the platform failed to redirect the user to the full-screen configuration page. This change restores the expected user experience in Classic UI, ensuring consistent navigation during OAuth integration setup. It eliminates the need for manual intervention and improves the reliability of the integration configuration process. |
| Integrations | Single Sign-On | Fixed | Fixed an issue with SSO login when the "Use Freedom UI interface" (`UseNewShell` code) system setting was set to "false." Previously, after login, users were redirected to an empty page with the Creatio logo only. |
| Integrations | Creatio Messaging Service | Changed | Improved the encryption algorithm in the Creatio Messaging Service for all users who have Creatio on-site using Avaya or Cisco Enterprise phone connectors.<br>More details<br>For all users who have Creatio on-site using Avaya or Cisco Enterprise phone connectors:<br>1. Contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to receive the latest version of CMS installer.<br>2. Update CMS to the latest version when upgrading the Creatio instance to version 8.3.1. |
| Integrations | Caching | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the chat agent cache logic that could cause loss of `DirectedChats` in customizations. The `GetOperator()` method now ignores empty `operatorId` values, preventing unnecessary cache resets.<br>More details<br>Previously, the `GetOperator(Guid operatorId)` method that is used by `RemoveDirectedChat`, `UpdateActiveChatsCount`, and `AddDirectedChat` refreshed the entire cache from the database if the agent was not found. For the `ForEveryoneOperatorRoutingRule` strategy, the `DirectedOperatorId` value in the database could be empty, which caused all agents in the cache to lose their `DirectedChats` until `Distribute` was called. |
| Integrations | Quartz task scheduler | Changed | Added functionality to run Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft 365 calendar synchronization processes in a dedicated `CalendarSyncScheduler` Quartz thread. This change significantly improves calendar synchronization stability for high-load websites. |
| Integrations | SVN integration | Fixed | Fixed an issue where schema resources were incorrectly marked as modified after discarding changes to an object and committing to SVN through the UI. Previously, after discarding object changes and committing the package, schema resources were still marked as modified due to improper checksum recalculation, causing false positives in the list of modified elements. Now, the platform accurately reflects the discarded state, improving consistency between the UI and SVN status. This change eliminates unnecessary commitments and ensures cleaner package states. |
| Integrations | Email Listener | Changed | Added domain whitelist configuration in Email Listener for outgoing requests. All integration operations, for example, getting mailbox folders, creating subscriptions, and updating OAuth tokens, are now checked against a list of allowed domains. If the domain does not match, the request is blocked and logged with the "SomeURL address not allowed for outgoing requests" error.<br>More details<br>- Added a new "whitelist.yaml" file to store the list of allowed domains, managed by the `Security.WhiteListSecret` configuration option.<br>  <br>- Added a new `/api/whitelist/get` endpoint to check the current whitelist state. The endpoint access requires authorization. If the response is empty, the whitelist is disabled.<br>  <br>- Added logging of the whitelist state at the start of each Pod:<br>  - "Loaded SomeNumber allowed domains from whitelist.yaml" indicates that the whitelist is enabled and domains are loaded.<br>  - "SomeURL does not exist, outgoing requests whitelist disabled" indicates that whitelist rules are not found and all requests are allowed. |
| Integrations | Email Listener | Fixed | Fixed an issue with synchronizing emails that include attachments.<br>More details<br>Previously, if automatic virus scanning was enabled for attachments in Office 365, the attachment was sometimes unavailable during synchronization with Creatio because the scan was still in progress. Now, Email Listener returns such emails to the synchronization queue and retries synchronization later. |
| Integrations | Webhooks | Changed | Added a warning when the "Creatio Webhook Service" technical user lacks access rights to process incoming webhooks or when webhook integration is misconfigured. This change helps detect and resolve integration issues more quickly. |
| Integrations | Webhooks | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the "Populate Contact with Submission Data" business process failed to transfer submission details to the "Contact" (`Contact` code) object due to timing conflicts with another process that specified the `ContactId` parameter. Previously, when a "FormSubmit" type webhook was received, contact page fields such as **Registration method**, **Customer need**, **Source**, and **Channel** remained unfilled because the `ContactId` parameter was assigned later by another process. Now, the process also tracks changes to the `ContactId` parameter in the "Submission" (`FormSubmit` code) object along with reacting to its creation. This change ensures correct and consistent population of contact page fields from web form submissions. |
| Integrations | OData | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the OData API where date values could be stored incorrectly due to improper time zone calculations. In some cases, the date saved in Creatio did not match the value originally passed in the OData request. Now, Creatio stores date values exactly as provided, ensuring accuracy and consistency in data handling across integrations. This change improves data integrity, especially for time-sensitive business processes. |
| Business processes | Business process execution | Changed | Optimized memory usage in the `ProcessSchemaParameter` class by skipping initialization of the `ItemProperties` property when it includes no elements. This change reduces the memory footprint for process schema parameters. The functionality is managed by the `ProcessFeatures.DoNotInitializeEmptyItemProperties` additional feature. Out of the box, "true." |
| Business processes | Business process completion | Fixed | Fixed an issue where a business process that opened a record page did not complete after saving the page changes the first time. The process now finishes correctly upon saving when initiated through a process-triggered page open. The functionality is managed by the `OpenEditPageUserTask.CompleteOnlyBySaveButton` additional feature. Out of the box, "true." |
| Business processes | Process Designer | Fixed | Fixed the console error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'caption') at i.getLabelConfig" that could occur after arbitrary changes in a process, causing the Process Designer to fail to display the process diagram. |
| Business processes | Call Creatio.ai element | Changed | Improved error messages for the **Call Creatio.ai** element by returning detailed parsing issues when API skills fail to execute. This change helps diagnose and resolve parameter-related issues more effectively. |
| Business processes | Call Creatio.ai element | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Add files** parameter in the Process Designer for the **Call Creatio.ai** element disappeared after navigating to and updating the selected skill. The attachment UI now remains visible and functional. |
| Business processes | Call Creatio.ai element,<br>Process file element | Fixed | Fixed missing tooltip messages in the Process Designer for the **Call Creatio.ai** and **Process file** elements. Tooltips now provide clear configuration guidance and include links to relevant Academy articles. |
| Business processes | Emails sending | Changed | Prevented business processes from sending emails if sending is disabled in the mailbox configuration. |
| Business processes | Open edit page element | Changed | Improved the content of the **Which page to open?** parameter for the **Open edit page** element. The parameter now displays unique and descriptive names for page schemas, resolving confusion caused by duplicate records and helping users identify the desired schema correctly. |
| Business rules | Business rule execution | Fixed | Fixed the execution timing of business rules that use only `ViewModel` attributes selected in the **Attribute** parameter on the **Business rules setup** page. Previously, these rules waited for the data source to load before triggering. Now, they are executed immediately on page load if their conditions reference only `ViewModel` attributes, ensuring consistent UI behavior and faster response during form initialization. |
| Business rules | Business rule conditions | Changed | Added functionality to compare "Date/Time" type attributes and numeric type attributes with constants and other attributes of the same type in business rule conditions in Freedom UI. |
| Business rules | Business rule conditions | Changed | Added functionality to compare the "Current user contact" and "Current user account" system variables with "GUID" type columns in business rule conditions. |
| Business rules | UX | Fixed | Fixed an issue where searching for a specific role was not possible when building a business rule based on the current user's role if the instance contained many roles. This change ensures that filtering is correctly applied to the list of available roles. |
| Business rules | UX | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the list of "Lookup" type columns appeared empty in business rule conditions when opening a rule from the Object Designer. Now, all applicable "Lookup" type columns are displayed correctly, ensuring that users can configure conditions without missing fields. |
| End user experience | Classic UI shell | Deprecated | Announced official discontinuation of Classic UI shell since version 8.3.2. All environments still using the Classic UI shell will be automatically switched to the Freedom UI shell during the upgrade to version 8.3.2. This change affects panels, navigation, communication areas, and related elements only. All existing functionality, including Classic UI sections, will remain unaffected and continue to work as before. Administrators can enable the Freedom UI shell in advance for selected users, roles, or the entire organization to prepare for the transition. If you encounter any issues, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com). |
| End user experience | Creatio login page | Changed | Excluded the `lottie-player.js` library from loading on the Creatio login page to optimize network traffic consumption. |
| End user experience | Creatio login page | Changed | Changed the text and UI of the warning message on the Creatio login page that appears when a user accesses Creatio with an unsupported or outdated browser version. The functionality is managed by the "Displaying on the login page notification about browsers that are not supported" (`ShowUnsupportedBrowser` code) system setting. Out of the box, "true." |
| End user experience | 2FA | Changed | Improved 2FA login performance by removing blocking logic execution from the login flow, which previously triggered system-wide user checks and caused delays. |
| End user experience | Translations | Changed | Changed the **Apply translations** button in the **Translation** section to trigger a background "Apply translations" business process instead of a direct action that blocked the UI with a loading mask. Previously, administrators launched the business process manually. The process is now integrated directly into section UI and runs asynchronously without interrupting the workflow. Administrators can monitor progress using standard process monitoring tools. |
| End user experience | Translations | Fixed | Fixed an issue where homepage titles were sometimes displayed in the primary language culture for users that have different language cultures. Previously, the issue could be resolved manually by applying translations in the **Translation** section or by changing and re-saving the homepage title. |
| End user experience | Translations | Fixed | Fixed an issue where translation update could incorrectly display values from the middle of the schema hierarchy in the **Translation** section. Previously, this occurred in cases when a schema was modified in the middle of the hierarchy, and a full update was not performed afterward. Now, Creatio consistently displays the correct translation values based on the full schema hierarchy, eliminating inconsistencies caused by partial updates and ensuring reliable localization even in complex configuration scenarios. |
| End user experience | Caching | Changed | Added caching for the "Default messages exchange library" (`SysMsgLib` code) system setting to improve platform performance, since this setting is read each time the **Calls** tab of the communication panel is opened. |
| End user experience | Screen reader support | Changed | Added screen reader support for task completion actions in the **Next steps** component to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | Screen reader support | Changed | Added screen reader support for adding, modifying, and moving meetings in the **Calendar** component to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | Screen reader support | Changed | Added screen reader support for successfully sent messages in chats to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | Keyboard navigation | Changed | Improved the keyboard focus indicator for the "Web link" and "Email" type fields to align with the visual style of other UI elements, ensuring consistent UX, enhancing visual coherence, and improving usability. |
| End user experience | Keyboard navigation | Changed | Improved the keyboard focus indicator for links in the **Feed** component to align with other UI elements and ensure consistent UX. |
| End user experience | Keyboard navigation | Fixed | Fixed the keyboard focus indicator for user list records when mentioning someone with "@" in the **Feed** component. |
| End user experience | Next steps component | Changed | Changed the **Complete** button in the **Next steps** component to support dynamic width and display longer labels in different languages, such as Spanish or German. |
| End user experience | Button component | Fixed | Fixed the accessibility issue where the screen reader announced the **Back** button incorrectly on filter pages that use the **Hierarchy** component with additional filters, such as the **Product selection** page opened from the **Products** expanded list on the order page. The redundant `role` attribute was removed to ensure consistent and correct announcement. |
| End user experience | List component | Changed | Added clickable links in the **List** component views to improve navigation and usability.<br>More details<br>The improvement affects the following schemas:<br>- "Add event audience page" (`AddEventAudiencePage` code)<br>- "Add bulk email audience page" (`AddBulkEmailAudiencePage` code)<br>- "Select ad accounts page" (`SelectAdAccountsLookupPage` code)<br>- "Email templates lookup page" (`EmailTemplatesLookupPage` code)<br>- "OAuth client app allowed users selection page" (`OAuthClientUsersSelectionPage` code)<br>- "Select roles" (`AddRolesSelectionPage` code)<br>- "Select existing process" (`CopilotSelectExistingProcessForActionPage` code)<br>- "Lookup page" (`CopilotSelectExistingSkillForAgentPage` code) |
| End user experience | List component,<br>List widget component,<br>Gallery component | Changed | Added a new **Merge** action as the default bulk action for **List**, **List widget**, and **Gallery** components in runtime. This action lets you merge records manually directly from the UI in section lists, list widgets, and galleries. |
| End user experience | Multiselect lookup component | Changed | Added the **Required** parameter for the **Multiselect lookup** component in the Freedom UI Designer. Out of the box, set to "No." When set to "Yes," users must select at least one related record before saving changes. |
| End user experience | Message composer component | Changed | Improved the notification styles in the **Message composer** component for "Feed" and "Email" channels to align with other UI elements and ensure consistent UX. |
| End user experience | Message composer component | Changed | Changed icon padding in the **Message composer** component to prevent text overlapping with characters like "y," "p," "g," and "j."<br>More details<br>- For "Email" channel, padding was increased for the **Select attachments**, **Insert template**, and **Formatting options** buttons.<br>- For "Feed" channel, padding was increased for the **Select attachments** and **Formatting options** buttons. |
| End user experience | Message composer component | Fixed | Changed the behavior of the **Reply all** button in the **Message composer** component. Now, when replying from the email page or timeline, the user's own email address is excluded from the recipient list to prevent receiving a copy of their reply. |
| End user experience | Feed component,<br>Message composer component | Changed | Added a new **Enable accessibility-optimized mode for page components** checkbox on the **Accessibility settings** tab of the user profile page. Out of the box, cleared. When selected, extra animations in the **Feed** and **Message composer** components are disabled to simplify keyboard navigation and improve screen reader performance. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the timeline component could display duplicate email tiles when multiple tabs were open. The timeline now correctly displays a single record for each email. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the timeline tile header overlapped the second line of text when the header did not fit within a single line. |
| End user experience | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the email body displayed in the timeline could differ from the original content if the draft of a large email was modified but its preview was not updated. This change ensures consistency between the displayed and actual email content. |
| End user experience | Timer component | Changed | Changed the default color for negative values in the **Timer** component to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | Playbook component | Changed | Improved article filtering in the **Playbook** component for objects with multiple dynamic cases. Previously, all articles assigned to the same stage were displayed, even if they belonged to different dynamic cases. Now, articles are filtered by the specific dynamic case, showing only those relevant to the current case and stage. |
| End user experience | Calendar component | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the **Calendar** component where component data was not displayed when switching between tabs. The issue occurred when one tab contained a **List** component, and another tab contained a **Calendar** component. Data is now displayed correctly in this configuration. |
| End user experience | Tabs component | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the incorrect tab header was displayed as active after toggling tab panel visibility. The tab panel behavior was adjusted to ensure the active tab header matches the rendered tab content when tabs are shown or hidden dynamically. |
| End user experience | Tabs component | Fixed | Fixed the UI rendering issue where fully colored tabs sometimes inherited the default background color due to CSS load order. This occurred when navigating away from a page that contains tabs and returning to it, causing incorrect tab coloring and reducing header content visibility. The tab styling logic was updated to ensure consistent appearance regardless of CSS evaluation sequence. |
| End user experience | Toggle panel component | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the toggle panel displayed incorrect content when certain toggles were hidden using the `"visible": false` property in the source code of the Freedom UI page. Previously, the panel displayed the content of the next visible toggle instead of the selected toggle. The rendering logic was updated to ensure that content always corresponds to the selected toggle, regardless of other toggle visibility. The toggle panel now consistently displays the correct content, improving UI accuracy in dynamic configurations. |
| End user experience | Toggle panel component | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **List** component inside the `TabContainer` container of the **Toggle panel** component sometimes disappeared after quickly adding multiple **Summaries** components linked to it, most often on section pages. |
| End user experience | Action dashboard component (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed an issue with the **Action dashboard** component when Freedom UI was enabled. Previously, clicking the **Add task** button opened the **Activities** Classic UI section page. Now, it opens the **Tasks** Freedom UI section page. |
| End user experience | Fields | Changed | Improved the user experience when working with fields that have long labels. If a field label is visually truncated due to limited space, a tooltip now appears on pointing to display the full label text. |
| End user experience | Fields | Fixed | Fixed an issue where a required field that had validators configured lost those validators after changing the value of another page field. All validations now remain active when related fields are updated. |
| End user experience | "Rich text" type field | Fixed | Fixed an issue where pressing Ctrl+Z in a "Rich text" type field could incorrectly restore content from the same field of a different record. Undo operations now affect only the content of the current record. |
| End user experience | "Rich text" type field | Fixed | Fixed the performance issue that caused the browser tab to freeze when reopening the same record page that contains a "Rich text" type field. The issue occurred on pages with many fields that were opened multiple times and was caused by duplicated DOM attributes during repeated rendering. The fix removes redundant attribute assignments, ensuring stable performance across repeated loads of the same content. |
| End user experience | "Phone" type field | Fixed | Fixed an issue where a "Phone" type field whose **Display input mask** checkbox in the Freedom UI Designer was selected prevented saving records until the field was clicked. Now, such unchanged fields no longer block record saving. |
| End user experience | "Phone" type field | Fixed | Fixed an issue with "Phone" type field whose **Display input mask** checkbox in the Freedom UI Designer was selected when their values were set via a request handler. If a value was copied from one "Phone" type field to another, the target field remained in an invalid state even though the displayed value was correct. Now, "Phone" type fields update their validation state properly when values are set programmatically. |
| End user experience | "Email" type field | Changed | Increased the contrast ratio of the email icon in the "Email" type field to comply with WCAG. |
| End user experience | "Encrypted string" type field | Changed | Added switching between masked and unmasked views for "Encrypted string" type fields using the ![btn_visible.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCodePlatform/set_up_dashboards/btn_visible.png)button. Users who have appropriate permissions can reveal sensitive values when needed and hide them as required, with consistent behavior during edit, save, and cancel operations. |
| End user experience | "Encrypted string" type field | Changed | Added functionality to view masked values in "Encrypted string" type fields whose **Read-only** checkbox in the Freedom UI Designer is selected. Users can click the **Eye** button to reveal the value without gaining the ability to modify it. |
| End user experience | "Dropdown" type field | Fixed | Fixed copying of values in the "Dropdown" type field displayed as hyperlinks when the **Read-only** checkbox in the Freedom UI Designer is selected. Users can now select and copy the value as easily as plain text. |
| End user experience | Multiple page data sources | Changed | Improved performance when opening pages that contain multiple page data sources. Secondary (dependent) data sources begin loading as soon as their primary data source, or any other source they depend on, start loading, allowing them to load in parallel. |
| End user experience | Multiple page data sources | Changed | Improved the data saving logic for pages with multiple dependent data sources by updating backend-level validation. Previously, only frontend validation prevented inconsistent saves. If a backend validation failed in one dependent data source, the platform could still save data to the others, resulting in partial and inconsistent updates. The platform now evaluates backend validation rules, such as required fields configured at the object level but not displayed on the page, before saving data. If validation fails in any dependent data source, the platform blocks the entire save, excluding collections and independent data sources, and prevents partial updates, ensuring data consistency and record integrity. The functionality is managed by the `DataSource-DisableTransactions` additional feature. Out of the box, "false." |
| End user experience | Business process execution | Changed | Improved the behavior of record selection after business process execution in Freedom UI pages to prevent accidental repeated execution. Previously, the last active record stayed selected after a process was triggered, which could cause unintended repeat runs and workspace clutter. Now, all involved records are automatically deselected after execution, preventing repeated actions and keeping the workspace clear. The update supports multiple buttons and lists on the same page for consistent behavior. Behavior in Classic UI pages remains unchanged. |
| End user experience | Business rule applying | Fixed | Fixed an issue where object-level filtering business rules did not work in the "Dropdown" type field whose **Lookup view** parameter in the Freedom UI Designer was set to "Selection window." Previously, the issue occurred in editable lists. |
| End user experience | Page opening | Fixed | Fixed the console error "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'instance') at yn.\_createOrUpdateView" that occurred when opening a record page first as a process page and then reopening it as a standard record page in the same browser tab. The view is now correctly initialized when switching contexts, preventing the null reference error. |
| End user experience | Page loading | Changed | Optimized runtime loading of Freedom UI pages opened in background browser tabs. This change reduces delays caused by browser tab throttling mechanisms. The improvement affects timer execution mechanism in background tabs. Actual performance gains might vary depending on the browser's background tab behavior.<br>More details<br>The functionality is managed by the `WorkerTimers` additional feature. Out of the box, "false." If the issue of page loading occurs again and you have to change the status of the `WorkerTimers` additional feature, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to implement changes in the platform. |
| End user experience | Page performance | Fixed | Fixed an issue that impacted performance by triggering unnecessary data source reloads after record deletion. |
| End user experience | UX | Fixed | Fixed an issue where 8-digit numbers could occasionally display incorrectly or appear as "0" on pages. The number formatting library was updated from `numeral` 2.0.6 to `numbro` 2.5.0. |
| End user experience | Excel export | Changed | Added functionality to track "Export to Excel" operations in the audit log. The functionality is managed by the "Log export to Excel events" (`UseExportToExcelLog` code) system setting. Out of the box, "false."<br>More details<br>When "true," the audit log captures:<br>- who performed the export<br>- when the export occurred<br>- which object was exported<br>- total number of records<br>- exact list of exported columns<br>This change applies to exports performed from both Freedom UI and Classic UI pages. |
| End user experience | Excel import | Fixed | Fixed the access rights mechanism for Excel import. Previously, an issue with insufficient permission for lookups connected to the main imported object could occur. |
| End user experience | Emails | Changed | Implemented preservation of connection fields on the email page when replying to an email. All connections remain the same in the reply, and the email reply is displayed properly in the timeline records. |
| End user experience | Chats | Changed | Optimized performance for environments that contain many support agents, queues, and chats. Multiple platform components were optimized to reduce web server CPU load and database utilization, with the greatest effect in scenarios involving 100+ active agents working under the "To an available agent" chat distribution strategy. The functionality is managed by the `UseOmnichannelOptimizedOperatorsCache` additional feature that applies optimized caching mechanisms for agent distribution. Out of the box, "true." These improvements enhance scalability and ensure smoother platform performance under high data volumes. |
| End user experience | Chats | Fixed | Fixed the "There is no conversation with this contact." error that prevented starting a new chat in Creatio when the previous conversation with the contact was closed and the last 20+ messages were sent by an agent. Chat history is now handled correctly, allowing new sessions to start regardless of message direction in past conversations. |
| End user experience | File processing | Changed | Added a new warning message when file uploads are in progress. Creatio now displays a warning if the user attempts to close the browser window or tab while a file is still uploading. The functionality is managed by the `AllowSkipBusyCheckOnDetail` additional feature. Out of the box, "true." This change prevents users from closing the browser with unfinished uploads, which could otherwise result in corrupt or incomplete files. |
| End user experience | File storages | Changed | Added support for a new authorization method for Azure Blob file storage that uses **Client ID**, **Client secret**, and **Tenant ID** instead of **Account name** and keys. This approach aligns with Microsoft's best practices, enhances security and permission control, and helps administrators manage permissions more precisely while ensuring compliance with security standards. |
| End user experience | File storages | Fixed | Fixed an issue that prevented users, including external users, from uploading files larger than 500 KB to S3 file storage. Previously, the upload process triggered a permission issue due to missing update rights on the **Size** field, which is updated during chunked uploads. Now, only create permission is required for successful uploads, regardless of file size. The functionality is managed by the `FileApiFeatures.IgnoreAdminRightsOnChunkUpload` additional feature. Out of the box, "true." |
| End user experience | Web services | Fixed | Fixed an issue in `rest/VisaDataService/GetVisaEntities` that caused duplicate approval records when multiple records existed in the `SysModuleEntity` database table for the same schema. For example, the "Account" (`Account` code) object with both Freedom UI and Classic UI pages. Previously, duplicate records remained visible in Creatio Mobile. The logic now ensures unique approval records across both Freedom UI and Classic UI, including Creatio Mobile. |
| End user experience | Chats (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed the display issue in omnichannel messaging where the chat start date was not converted to the user's time zone in Classic UI. This change caused a one-day discrepancy in the date divider and system messages on the Classic UI chat page. |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migrated the `mat-card` component to Angular Material library version 16.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-card` with `mat-mdc-card`<br>- `mat-card-title` with `mat-mdc-card-title` |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migrated the `mat-progress-bar` component to Angular Material library version 16.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-progress-bar` with `mat-mdc-progress-bar`<br>- `mat-progress-bar-element` with `mdc-linear-progress__bar`<br>- `mat-progress-bar-buffer` with `mdc-linear-progress__buffer`<br>- `mat-progress-bar-background` with `mat-mdc-progress-bar` and `mdc-linear-progress__buffer` |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migrated the `mat-progress-spinner` component to Angular Material library version 16.<br>More details<br>Replaced the `mat-spinner` CSS class with `mat-mdc-progress-spinner`. |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migrated the `mat-tooltip` component to Angular Material library version 16.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-tooltip` with `mat-mdc-tooltip`<br>- `mat-tooltip-hide` with `mat-mdc-tooltip`<br>- `mat-tooltip-trigger` with `mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger`<br>- `mat-tooltip-panel-left` with `mat-mdc-tooltip-panel-left`<br>- `mat-tooltip-panel-right` with `mat-mdc-tooltip-panel-right`<br>- `mat-tooltip-panel-above` with `mat-mdc-tooltip-panel-above`<br>- `mat-tooltip-panel-below` with `mat-mdc-tooltip-panel-below` |
| Advanced customization | Creatio version update | Changed | Migrated the `mat-list` component to Angular Material library version 16.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-list` with `mat-mdc-list`<br>- `mat-list-base` with `mat-mdc-list-base`<br>- `mat-list-item` with `mat-mdc-list-item` |
| Advanced customization | Configuration section | Changed | Improved the UI of the validation window in the **Configuration** section that appears when changing package dependencies and validation fails. The update provides a clearer presentation of validation results when issues are detected.<br>More details<br>The new window now includes a descriptive title and a structured table that lists all issues with the following columns:<br>- "Type" is the schema type<br>- "Name" is the name of the schema causing the error<br>- "Description" is context related to the schema<br>- "Package" is the package where the schema is stored |
| Advanced customization | Schema management | Fixed | Fixed the logic for handling view deletions during schema updates involving simultaneous changes to column types and schema or column names. Previously, such changes could cause errors due to the view recreation process relying on outdated schema or column references. Now, the platform prevents the deletion of views belonging to the current schema (both built-in and custom) when a column type is changed along with a rename. This change avoids failures during view recreation when source references no longer match.<br>More details<br>If a view in the same schema depends on the modified column, an error is raised to prevent invalid operations. Views in external schemas (such as masking views) continue to be deleted and recreated correctly under these conditions. This change ensures safer and more predictable schema updates. |
| Advanced customization | Schema management | Fixed | Fixed the validation issue in the `CrtProductCatalogueInInvoice` package caused by an inaccessible dependency on the `VwInvoiceProductPostgreSql` SQL script from the `Invoice` package. The SQL script is now correctly accessible during validation to prevent SQL script errors. |
| Advanced customization | Schema management | Fixed | Fixed invalid column references in the "Installment plan state" (`SupplyPaymentState` code) object. Previously, multiple column IDs pointed to non-existent columns, which could cause runtime errors and schema compilation issues. All invalid references were removed to ensure schema consistency and prevent potential deployment problems. |
| Advanced customization | App building | Changed | Deprecated the `CrtDesignerCommand` decorator. The deprecated decorator was replaced with the `CrtInterfaceDesignerModule` decorator to support removing unused code during app build. Previously, commands were registered via the `side-effect.ts` file, which prevented removing unused code. Now, commands are registered using an enhanced decorator that leverages metadata and separate registries for internal and external use. This change enables removing unused code to exclude unused commands, improves build efficiency, and simplifies adding new commands without breaking backward compatibility.<br>More details<br>- Introduced logic to differentiate internal and public command implementations using a static flag.<br>- Created separate metadata keys and registries for internal commands.<br>- Adapted `interface-designer-module.ts`, `DesignerCommandFactoryService`, and related infrastructure to use the internal command registry.<br>- Updated base commands to use the `CrtInterfaceDesignerModule` decorator and removed side-effect imports.<br>- Added the `CrtInterfaceDesignerModule` in modules that previously relied on side effects. |
| Advanced customization | App installation | Changed | Applied the same validation rules for the `InstallApp` and `InstallZipPackage` operation of the WorkspaceConsole utility as for app installation via the Application Hub.<br>More details<br>Added the following validation rules for the `InstallApp` operation:<br>- Creatio version compatibility<br>- missing dependencies<br>- minimum required version of dependent apps<br>Added the validation rule for missing dependencies in the `InstallZipPackage` operation. |
| Advanced customization | Package dependencies | Changed | Changed the package hierarchy by moving the `Timeline` dependency from the `Document` package to the `CrtDocument` package. |
| Advanced customization | Package dependencies | Fixed | Fixed the incorrect package dependency for `CrtOrderVisaProvider` package that caused access issues to the "Notification provider" (`NotificationProvider` code) object in the `CrtNUI` package. The package properties now explicitly declare dependencies on the `CrtOrder` package, ensuring proper resolution and availability of related schemas. |
| Advanced customization | Components | Changed | Added support for bindings to attributes inside nested collections in the Freedom UI components that work with collections. For example, when a collection rendered in the template list includes a nested collection that is passed to the `items` property of a **Data grid** component used as a template, bindings like `$ParentCollection.NestedCollection.Id` for the `cellView` and `editingCellView` properties of the **Data grid** component work correctly. |
| Advanced customization | Feed component | Changed | Added support for the new `isReadOnly` property in the **Feed** component. The property defines whether to lock new posts and comments, leaving only the **Like** button available. To ensure feed records are displayed correctly, bind the appropriate attribute to the `isReadOnly` property. When the bound attribute value changes, the component fields are shown or hidden automatically. |
| Advanced customization | Timeline component | Changed | Added support for the new `isTileReadOnly` property in the "Feed" channel of the **Timeline** component. The property defines whether to lock new posts and comments, leaving only the **Like** button available. To ensure feed records display correctly in the timeline, bind the appropriate attribute to the `isTileReadOnly` property. When the bound attribute value changes, the component fields are shown or hidden automatically. |
| Advanced customization | Data model attribute | Changed | Added logic to mark attributes as changed during `update()` calls in the `@creatio-devkit/common` library, excluding the `primaryAttributeName` property. This change ensures that updates work correctly without requiring manual attribute change tracking. |
| Advanced customization | Web services | Changed | Added the `AnonymousFeatureService.svc` web service that retrieves additional features from a predefined, strictly limited whitelist before user login. It returns the statuses of additional features using the same DTOs as the `FeatureService` service in the `@creatio-devkit/common` library.<br>More details<br>Added the following features to the whitelist:<br>- `CommonFeatures.UseCustomCoreLocalizations`. Out of the box, registered and disabled.<br>- `UseRoleBasedLicenseDistribution`. Out of the box, registered and enabled. |
| Advanced customization | EntitySchemaQuery class | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the `EntitySchemaQuery` class with `UseAdminRights = false` returned "NULL" for some columns if the current user lacked read permissions. This caused certain filters and subqueries to fail or behave inconsistently compared to supervisor queries. The issue was identified in `CopilotSessionEnt`-related queries and resolved to ensure columns are properly returned under restricted user permissions when `UseAdminRights` is set to `false`. |
| Advanced customization | Data binding | Changed | Replaced encryption algorithm for data bindings that contain the secure text data type (not recommended). Now, bindings to encrypted system settings created in version 8.3 and earlier are no longer installed into instances running version 8.3.1 and later. If bindings are still needed, recreate them on version 8.3.1 and later. |
| Advanced customization | Translations | Changed | Added functionality to run the "Update translations" business process directly from the **Translation** section. Previously, administrators could launch the process manually, and the platform updated translations automatically when opening the section that blocked the UI. Now, platform no longer updates translations automatically, and clicking the new **Update translations** button runs the process in the background. This opens the **Translation update settings** window that informs users about the upcoming background execution and provides the option to run the update from scratch, clearing the relevant system setting and the `SysTranslation` table. Once the process is completed, a notification is displayed on the notification panel. This change improves performance, speeds up page load, gives administrators full control over the update process and lets them choose the appropriate moment to run it. |
| Advanced customization | Translations | Changed | Changed the "Actualize translations" business process to remove outdated records in addition to updating and adding records. Previously, deletion of outdated translation records in the `SysTranslation` database table occurred only during the execution of "Apply translations" business process. Now, outdated records are automatically removed during the execution of "Actualize translations" business process, ensuring the **Translation** section stays consistent without requiring a separate cleanup step. |
| Advanced customization | Translations | Changed | Improved the translation process for schema names by automatically synchronizing the translation of "Schema" (`SysSchema` code) object data with the caption translation of the corresponding configuration key. Previously, users had to translate the schema caption once for the configuration key and again for the data record with the key `Data:SysSchema.SomeId`, which could result in inconsistent translations across different parts of the app. Now, once the configuration key caption is translated, the same translation is automatically applied to the related "Schema" (`SysSchema` code) object data. This change reduces the risk of errors, enhances translation accuracy, and simplifies localization maintenance. To clean up outdated `Data:SysSchema.SomeId` records, run the "Actualize translations" business process from scratch after upgrading the Creatio instance to version 8.3.1. |
| Advanced customization | Translations | Changed | Improved the logic for generating records in the `SysEntitySchemaReference` database table to produce consistent identifiers for the same object-field pair across different environments. Previously, records in this table could receive different IDs for the same object-field combination depending on the environment. Since IDs remain consistent, this enables accurate and reliable transfer of translations linked to `SysEntitySchemaReference` records between environments using Excel import, without mapping errors or conflicts. This change simplifies localization workflows and enhances cross-environment consistency. |
| Administration | System Designer | Changed | Hidden **Section Wizard** and **Detail Wizard** from the **System setup** block in the System Designer to streamline the transition to Freedom UI. |
| Administration | Licensing | Fixed | Fixed an issue where users added to an external organization could receive duplicate licenses. If the same license set for automatic distribution was assigned both to the role and to the external organization, the user was given two license records. In this case, licenses were not visible to the administrator, but duplicate records were still recorded in the `SysLicUser` database table.<br>More details<br>Updated the license distribution logic to correctly handle overlapping assignments, ensuring each license is issued only once per user. This change prevents over-allocation, improves license management accuracy, and ensures transparency for administrators. |
| Administration | OAuth authorization | Changed | Implemented restrictions to prevent manual editing of historical OAuth shared access data to ensure integrity and consistency of authorization records. Previously, editing this data was blocked on the **OAuth integrated applications** page, but administrators could still modify it via alternative sources such as the **Lookups** section. This data is used to track user consent for external applications and must remain unaltered outside of system-managed operations. Now, attempts to edit it generate a descriptive error message. This change reinforces data protection and audit reliability in integration scenarios. |
| Administration | OAuth authorization | Changed | Added functionality to share access to external applications integrated with authorization code grant by roles in addition to individual users. When a new user is added to a role, the appropriate integration access is applied automatically without manual configuration. This change simplifies management of integration permissions in large or dynamic user groups. |
| Administration | OAuth authorization | Changed | Added session tracking for external applications to enhance visibility into OAuth integrations. Administrators can now differentiate between user sessions and those initiated by external applications on behalf of a user, improving auditability and control.<br>More details<br>- Added a new **User sessions** non-editable list to the **Monitoring** tab of the OAuth integration page that displays all sessions initiated by external applications integrated with authorization code grant. The list includes the following columns: "User," "Session start," "Session end," "IP address," "Client name."<br>- Added a new "External application" column to the **Sessions** expanded list to the **Access rules** tab on the user page in the **Users** section. The column is populated only when the session was started by an external application. |
| Administration | Identity Service | Changed | Added the `ForceHttpsSchemeInRequests` setting to the "appsettings.json" file in the Identity Service root directory. Out of the box, `true`, which forces the Identity Service to use the HTTPS schema in its responses regardless of the incoming request schema. This change ensures the Identity Service returns the HTTPS schema in the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint response, even when deployed behind a proxy where HTTPS is terminated before reaching the app. Previously, when the Identity Service was hosted in IIS and HTTPS was handled at the proxy level, the endpoint returned URLs with the HTTP schema. This could disrupt OAuth grants by causing integrity or redirection issues. |
| Administration | Identity Service | Fixed | Fixed an issue that caused platform unavailability when the "Identity server Url" (`IdentityServerUrl` code) system setting included an invalid address. Previously, an incorrectly configured value, for example, with a backslash, caused the platform to become inaccessible. Now, the platform continues to operate while excluding Identity Service functionality and logs a clear message about the connection issue. This change improves platform resilience and troubleshooting clarity, helping administrators identify and resolve misconfiguration issues quickly.<br>More details<br>- Adjusted the system setting handling logic to avoid unavailability.<br>- Implemented clear logging to inform administrators about connection failures to the specified Identity Service path. |
| Administration | Identity Service | Fixed | Fixed the silent failure issue in Identity Service that occurred when the required PFX certificate was not configured. Previously, the service stopped shortly after launch without providing any error messages or useful logs. Now, when the Identity Service is started without a PFX certificate, it displays an explicit error message in the console and writes a corresponding record to the log. This change improves troubleshooting and helps users quickly identify and fix misconfiguration issues related to certificate setup. |
| Administration | OpenID authentication | Changed | Changed static error message texts for OpenID authentication on the Creatio login page that contains localizable strings. Previously, OpenID-related errors were displayed in English only, regardless of the user's language culture. Now, these messages support localization, improving the experience for non-English-speaking users, ensuring consistency across multilingual deployments, and enhancing accessibility for international teams. |
| Administration | Single Sign-On | Changed | Added functionality to disable JIT provisioning when using OpenID-based SSO. Previously, JIT provisioning was always enabled, which automatically synchronized user details from the identity provider every time a user logged in. Now, administrators can choose to disable this synchronization using the same checkbox available for SAML in the SSO settings. The functionality is managed by the `AllowDisablingOfUserProvisionDuringOpenIdLogin` additional feature. Out of the box, "false" for environments that use both SAML and OpenID-based SSO simultaneously. |
| Administration | Audit log | Changed | Changed the out-of-the-box behavior of column creation in audit log tables (`Sys<SchemaName>Log`) to mark new columns as nullable. This change prevents the database from setting default values for all existing records during package installation, which could previously lead to timeouts when modifying large tables. The functionality is managed by the `UseNullableColumnsInTrackChangesSchema` additional feature. Out of the box, "true." This change improves installation stability and performance when applying schema changes to high-volume data tables. |
| Administration | Global search | Changed | Added support for localization-aware indexing in global search. Previously, the indexing process relied on the primary language culture defined in the "Primary culture" (`PrimaryCulture` code) system setting, limiting flexibility and making localization changes impractical without major data operations. The new "Global Search localization for indexing" (`GlobalSearchIndexationLocalization` code) system setting defines the language culture used to index global search data. If the system setting value is empty, the primary language culture is used. This change simplifies localization management for global search without affecting platform performance and requires no user interaction. |
| Administration | Object Designer | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the "Contact" (`Contact` code) object was incorrectly listed as not administrated in warning messages when configuring pages for external users in Object Designer. The object is now correctly recognized as administrated, preventing misleading warnings during external page setup. |
| Administration | Package blocking,<br>Package deactivating | Changed | Blocked functionality to deactivate or delete a package if it or any of its dependencies is set as the value of the "Current package" (`CurrentPackageId` code) system setting. This change prevents errors in Freedom UI Designer and other elements.<br>More details<br>Previously, deactivating such a package cleared the system setting value, which caused errors in Freedom UI Designer and other elements. Now, if a user tries to deactivate or delete such a package, a descriptive error message is displayed. The functionality is managed by the `DisableCurrentPackageValidationOnDelete` additional feature. Out of the box, "false." |
| Administration | Page opening | Changed | Optimized repeated page opening by caching object metadata in persistent browser storage using IndexedDB. |
| Administration | Dashboards | Changed | Removed the permission check for the "Can manage configuration elements" (`CanManageSolution` code) system operation from read-only endpoints of the `EntitySchemaDesignerService`. The service is now available to all users, enabling its use in Dashboard Designer.<br>More details<br>Updated the following endpoints:<br>- `GetSchemaDesignItems`<br>- `GetAllAvailableSchemas`<br>- `GetAvailableReferenceSchemas`<br>- `GetAvailableParentSchemas`<br>- `GetAvailableParentSchemaByName` |
| Administration | Email Listener | Changed | Added installation instructions and configuration options to the Helm package of the Email Listener. |
| Administration | Message templates | Fixed | Fixed an issue where editing a template in the **Message templates** section required access rights to the "Access to "Lookups" section" (`CanManageLookups` code) system operation. Users outside the "System administrators" role received an issue when saving a template even if they had sufficient access rights. Template editing is now regulated only by operation and record permissions, without requiring the additional system operation permission. |
| Administration | Self-service portal | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the custom logo configured via the "Logo on login page for external users" (`SSPLogoImage` code) system setting was not displayed on the self-service portal login page. The fix also applies to the registration and password recovery pages. |
| Administration | File processing | Changed | Changed application-level "Web.config" file settings to prevent unintended Creatio restarts caused by IIS behavior during bulk updates to static content files. This change improves reliability and control during maintenance or deployment tasks, ensuring better uptime and smoother user experience. |
| Administration | File processing | Changed | Changed the mechanism for writing static content files from a blocking to a non-blocking approach. Previously, if a thread had not released a file, another thread attempting to write could cause the static content generation process to fail due to file lock conflicts. With the new non-blocking approach, static content generation is more robust and error-resistant in multi-threaded scenarios, reducing interruptions from file access conflicts and improving overall platform stability. |
| Administration | File processing | Fixed | Fixed the access rights mechanism for the "Image" (`SysImage` code) object. The standard record permissions now apply correctly to images. |
| Administration | Translations | Changed | Added functionality to skip translation validation when applying changes from the **Translation** section. This is useful in scenarios where only a small number of records are applied, and the user prefers to validate the results manually. Skipping validation significantly accelerates the platform process, especially in large environments where full validation of all records might be time-consuming. |
| Administration | Translations | Changed | Added a new "Percentage limit for concurrent translation processing" (`TranslationsConcurrencyLimitPercentage` code) system setting that lets administrators control the percentage of CPU threads allocated for translation operations, such as update and application. Out of the box, "50," in percents. Administrators can increase this value for faster processing or decrease it to reduce resource usage. The previously available "Apply translation concurrency limit" (`ApplyTranslationConcurrencyLimit` code) and "Translation update task concurrency limit" (`TranslationUpdateTaskConcurrencyLimit` code) system settings remain supported and take precedence if set. This change provides greater flexibility in managing system performance, especially in resource-constrained or high-load environments. |
| Administration | Translations | Fixed | Fixed an issue where untranslated records were not shown in the validation results if their values matched those of the primary language culture. This led to incomplete visibility of not applied translations. Now, Creatio reliably displays all untranslated records during validation, even when their content matches the primary language culture. This change improves transparency and ensures that administrators are fully informed about the status of all translation records. |
| Administration | Translations | Fixed | Fixed an issue where obsolete records in the **Translation** section were not fully removed during the first run of the "Apply translations" or "Actualize translations" business processes. This could require repeated operations to clean up obsolete records. Now, all outdated records are deleted reliably on the first attempt, improving data consistency and streamlining translation management. |
| Administration | Database management | Fixed | Fixed an issue where a failed package installation could leave database tables without primary keys if the failure occurred before constraint creation. Previously, republishing or updating the database structure did not restore the missing primary keys. Now, missing primary key constraints are correctly recreated during structure updates, preventing issues caused by incomplete table definitions. |
| Administration | User management | Fixed | Fixed an issue that allowed creating duplicate user records. The system now prevents adding case-insensitive or identical duplicates. |

## Creatio products and apps [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-1-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-products-and-apps "Direct link to Creatio products and apps")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer 360 | Account page | Changed | Added the **News & insights** tab to the account page to display relevant news and insights associated with the account. Users can interact with the tab using out-of-the-box filtering. This change supports better customer engagement and more efficient workflows by integrating contextual information into daily operations. Previously, account-related insights were not directly accessible from the account page, requiring users to navigate through separate modules or external tools. |
| Customer 360 | Account page | Changed | Added the **Products offered** and **How they make money** fields, as well as a **Competitors** expanded list, on the **Sales** tab of the account page. These fields can be automatically populated by the "Account profiling" AI Skill that uses the Google Search API to provide strategic business context. The enhancement centralizes critical information, improves data completeness, and supports informed sales strategy decisions. |
| Customer 360 | Account page | Fixed | Fixed an issue that prevented generating the **Full address** field when the displayed value in the **City**, **Country**, or **State/province** fields was changed from the default column. |
| Customer 360 | Contact page | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Save** button appeared incorrectly when switching between contact records. Previously, opening a second contact record whose contact has an additional middle name caused unintended double changes to the card title (`$NameAttribute`), triggering the save prompt unnecessarily. Now, the contact page title updates correctly without redundant changes or unnecessary save prompts when navigating between records. The fix is applied in Creatio versions 8.3–8.3.1. |
| Customer 360 | Account page,<br>Contact page | Fixed | Fixed an issue where **Communication options** on contact and account pages triggered multiple redundant loads and refreshes when multiple records were added before saving. Previously, each communication option caused a separate update, leading to performance inefficiencies and repeated UI refreshes. Now, the page refreshes only once upon saving, regardless of the number of records added. This change reduces unnecessary data processing and improves overall form page responsiveness. |
| Knowledge Management | Knowledge base | Fixed | Fixed an issue where filtering by the parent article in the **Knowledge base** section list did not work as expected. The static filter was designed to exclude articles whose "Parent article" column is populated, but due to missing read permissions on this column for the "All employees" and "All external users" roles, the platform could not apply the filter, and all versions were displayed. The fix grants read access to the "Parent article" column, enabling correct filtering and ensuring users see only the latest version. |
| Knowledge Management | Knowledge base article | Changed | Improved the behavior of creating and publishing knowledge base article drafts. Previously, when custom columns were added to the "Knowledge base article" (`KnowledgeBase` code) object, their values were not copied to the new version of an article. Now, custom column values are preserved. |
| Creatio Marketing | Bulk emails | Changed | Added functionality to delete bulk emails directly from the **Bulk emails** section when the **Status** column is set to "Draft" or "Planned." This change enables cleaning up outdated or unnecessary emails efficiently without having to remove them one by one. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing Page Designer | Fixed | Fixed an issue in Landing Page Designer where "Lookup" type fields in the **Form** element did not respect the defined primary and display value attributes. Instead, they incorrectly used only the **Id** and **Name** fields, which resulted in empty values when custom display columns were configured. Now, "Lookup" type fields correctly reflect the designated display value from the object configuration, ensuring consistent behavior and accurate data representation in forms. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing pages | Changed | Improved the logic for displaying the **Publish** and **Update** buttons in the Landing Page Designer to clearly reflect the publishing state based on page content and script changes. Creatio now determines button visibility using a hash comparison of the current and published content, including HTML structure, analytics stream ID, and URL slug. The **Publish** button appears for new pages that have valid content, while the **Update** button becomes visible only after changes are made to a previously published page. Pages without valid content do not display either button. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing pages | Changed | Implemented restrictions on sensitive or large-data fields in landing page form settings. Previously, administrators and marketers could configure forms with fields containing sensitive data or large datasets, which could cause performance issues or expose confidential information to external parties. Now, form settings display only permitted fields. Existing forms that already include restricted fields continue functioning normally, but the restricted fields will only be removed once the landing page is edited and saved again. This change helps prevent exposing internal data to external parties and reduces performance risks when working with large datasets.<br>More details<br>- Added the **Web form field deny list** lookup that defines object columns excluded from form configuration. Although the out-of-the-box list includes only "Lookup" type fields, administrators can restrict any column type, including "Text" and "Boolean." The object listed in the deny list must also be allowed in the **Webhook entities** lookup to be available for selection. When a previously allowed field is added to the deny list, it is excluded from the form upon the next save.<br>- Added the "Web form field records limit" (`WebFormFieldRecordsLimit` code) system setting that limits the number of records per "Lookup" type field in landing page form settings. Out of the box, "1,000." Creatio loads up to 1000 options for each lookup and ignores any excess records to maintain stable performance and predictable load times. For fields such as "Dropdown" type fields and single-choice lists, options can be added, edited, reordered, or removed through the field settings. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing pages | Fixed | Fixed an issue that prevented downloading landing page zip archives containing HTML files with linked images when users lacked shared permissions for those images. Previously, the download failed entirely. Now, the download process is completed successfully. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing pages | Fixed | Fixed an issue where users could submit landing page forms multiple times by repeatedly pressing the **Submit** button, which triggered multiple webhook calls for the same submission. This change improves platform reliability and prevents duplicated data handling.<br>More details<br>Added a mechanism to disable the **Submit** button immediately after the first click, preventing repeated triggers. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing pages | Fixed | Fixed an issue where fields with multiple selectable values in Landing Page Designer were sent with extra square brackets in their names, causing inconsistencies in submitted data. Now, field names are correctly formatted, ensuring clean and consistent data submission. |
| Creatio Marketing | Landing pages and web forms | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the **Landing pages and web forms** section where cases submitted through web-to-object forms had an incorrect registration date format when the user's language culture differed from the primary language culture. The issue was caused by outdated logic that interfered with the default mechanism for setting registration dates. This legacy logic was removed, allowing the base date handling to function correctly. The fix ensures accurate date values are saved regardless of the user's language culture and prevents format-related inconsistencies during case registration. |
| Creatio Marketing | Activities | Fixed | Fixed an issue that caused an error when creating an activity whose **Category** field in a **New record** window in the **Calendar** section was set to "Email" and that used a template referencing a non-existent bulk email. Previously, if the referenced bulk email record had been removed, the system attempted to generate a reply record without validating its existence, which caused an error. The fix adds a condition to verify the bulk email before creating a `BulkEmailReply` record. This change improves the stability and robustness of email activity handling, eliminating errors from missing bulk email references and ensuring reliable activity creation. |
| Lead Generation | Business process execution | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the "Lead consistency check" business process triggered LinkedIn-related validations even when LinkedIn integration was not enabled. This caused errors to be logged and displayed in the notification panel during nightly data checks. The process logic was adjusted to skip LinkedIn-specific checks for environments without the integration configured, preventing false error reports and improving clarity in system diagnostics. |
| Lead Generation | Facebook forms | Changed | Improved the lead retrieval process by using the base `QueueConsumerWorker()` method to re-add webhooks to the processing queue when lead details are not immediately available at the time of Facebook webhook receipt. The retry schedule is set at 15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the initial attempt. Previously, leads with incomplete or unavailable data caused processing issues and were not stored in Creatio. Now, delayed lead data is processed as soon as it becomes available from Facebook, reducing the risk of missing leads due to temporary unavailability. |
| Digital Ads | Account management | Changed | Added functionality for different users to link the same advertising account in the **Ad campaigns** section. This change allows multiple users to connect and manage identical accounts independently, improving flexibility in collaborative campaign management and reporting. |
| Email marketing | Bulk emails | Changed | Added a new **Preview text** field to the bulk email page. The field lets marketers enter pre-header text that is displayed in the recipient mailbox next to the email subject. |
| Email marketing | Bulk emails | Changed | Added the "Maximum count of languages for a bulk email" (`BulkEmailLanguagesMaxCount` code) system setting that limits the number of languages in a single bulk email. Out of the box, "4." If the defined limit is exceeded, Creatio displays a window that includes the link to relevant Academy article. This change improves overall platform stability and helps maintain optimal performance when managing multilingual and condition-based content in bulk emails. |
| Email marketing | Email Designer,<br>Landing Page Designer | Changed | Changed the preview functionality in Email Designer and Landing Page Designer to align with accessibility standards and modern UI practices. This change improves usability and delivers consistent UI across marketing design tools. |
| Marketing campaigns | Campaigns | Changed | Improved the campaign logging mechanism in Freedom UI by recording the user who initiated or stopped a campaign. Previously, the campaign progress check did not register the user responsible for these actions, which hindered audit and traceability. The platform now populates the "Created by" column in the campaign log when a campaign is started or stopped, handled through an update in the `CampaignExecutionLogger` logger that assigns the user identity responsible for these operations. Behavior in Classic UI campaigns remains unchanged. |
| Marketing campaigns | Campaigns | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the campaign page UI allowed multiple clicks on the **Start** button during slow response scenarios, potentially triggering duplicate campaign runs. Now, the button displays a loading animation and disables further interaction until the process finishes. This change prevents duplicate campaign starts and improves platform stability. |
| Marketing campaigns | Campaigns | Fixed | Fixed incorrect behavior in campaign execution triggered by record addition when the starting signal and bulk email objects referred to the same object other than "Contact" (`Contact` code) object. The fix ensures consistent object referencing during queue handling, preserving correct `LinkedEntityId` values for all campaign participants. Now, campaigns triggered by objects other than "Contact," e.g., custom objects linked to contacts, generate bulk email objects accurately for each triggering record. This change ensures templates are built using the correct object. |
| Creatio Service | UX | Fixed | Fixed an issue on the case Classic UI page where links in the case calculation deadline details window opened in a new tab but failed to load. The linked Freedom UI pages now open and load correctly. |
| Case Management | Cases | Fixed | Fixed an issue on the **Cases** section page where a warning about unsaved changes appeared even when no modifications were made. The message was incorrectly triggered after reloading the page, leading to confusion. |
| Creatio Sales | Forecasts | Fixed | Fixed the incorrect online help link in the **Forecasts** section. Previously, the help button redirected users to the Academy homepage. Now, it opens the "Set up a forecast" article as intended. |
| Creatio Sales | Attachments (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed the error that prevented changing the title of the **Attachments** detail on the lead Classic UI page. The issue was caused by missing properties in the page configuration. The detail setup now supports title customization as expected. |
| Order and Contract Management | Product management | Fixed | Fixed the misleading error shown when deleting a product not linked to any order from the **Product in order** lookup. Previously, the deletion succeeded but `OrderAmountHelper.GetOrderFinanceInfo()` assumed an associated order and raised an error. Now, the method handles a missing `OrderId`, and the record is deleted without incorrect notifications. |
| Creatio Financial Services CRM | Product management | Changed | Added the **Copy** action in the **Product detail** expanded list of the **Products** section. The action copies a product record together with its related data to speed up the creation of similar configurations. This change reduces manual input, improves consistency across product configurations, and provides clear feedback through successful confirmations and error messages when issues occur. Previously, users had to re-enter multiple related datasets to create similar products, which increased time and risk of data mismatches.<br>More details<br>Additionally, the **Copy** action executes the following:<br>- Duplicates "Customer parameters," "Product features," "Opportunity conditions," and "Documents package" columns.<br>- Allows users to edit the copied record before saving.<br>- Preserves relational integrity by linking all duplicated data to the new product record.<br>- Displays an exception message if the copy service returns an error.<br>- Displays a confirmation when the copy operation is complete. |
| Creatio Financial Services CRM | Consultation center | Changed | Added flexibility to the **Start consultation** button in the **Consultation center** panel. Administrators can now configure whether the button opens the contact page or launches a predefined business process.<br>More details<br>Added the "Start consultation business process" (`StartConsultationProcess` code) system setting. Out of the box, empty and the button opens the contact page. If populated, the button launches the selected business process and passes the `CaseId` parameter into it. |

| Advanced customization | Slider component | Added | Added support for the **Slider** component that displays an integer within a range and enables users to slide the value up and down with a preset step value. |

## Beta testing of new features [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-1-twin-changelog\#title-beta-testing-of-new-features "Direct link to Beta testing of new features")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Freedom UI Mobile Designer | Mobile page creation,<br>Mobile page customization | Added | Added a new Freedom UI Mobile Designer that lets you customize mobile pages using elements from the element library or the extended list of elements in the source code of the Freedom UI mobile page. The functionality is managed by the `UseMobilePageDesigner` additional feature. Out of the box, "false." The Freedom UI Mobile Designer in Creatio 8.3.1 Twin delivers limited functionality and provides an early opportunity to try it out.<br>More details<br>When the `UseMobilePageDesigner` additional feature is enabled:<br>- The **Select template** window in the No-code Designer includes the following tabs:<br>  - **Web pages**: templates for Creatio web pages<br>  - **Mobile app pages**: templates for Creatio mobile pages. Available templates: "Blank page mobile," "List page mobile," "Record page mobile."<br>- The element library of the Freedom UI Mobile Designer includes the following elements:<br>  <br>  <br>  - **Label** component<br>  - **Flex row** and **Flex column** layout elements<br>  - "Dropdown," "Text," "Number," "Date/Time," "Rich text," "Phone," "Email," "Web link" type inputs<br>The list of elements added to the canvas depends on the page template. |
| Business rules | Business rules for mobile pages | Added | Enabled the Business Rule Designer to work with mobile pages created in the new Freedom UI Mobile Designer. The functionality is managed by the `UseMobileDesignerBusinessRules` additional feature. Out of the box, "false." When "true," the ![btn_open_business_rules_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_open_business_rules_designer.png) button in the top right is displayed. |
| Administration | Workplace setup | Changed | Added functionality to select "Web" or "Mobile" usage type for each workplace. This change ensures that only sections of the matching type can be added to the workplace.<br>More details<br>Use "Web" for general purpose and "Mobile" to set up workspaces for Creatio Mobile only.<br>The functionality is managed by combination of the following additional features:<br>- `UseMobilePageDesigner`. Out of the box, "false." If "true," Creatio adds all mobile pages to the automatically created "My applications" workspace whose type is "Mobile."<br>- `DisableSetupMobileWorkplaces`. Out of the box, "false." If "true," Creatio restricts creating separate workspaces for Creatio Mobile. |
| Application Hub | App installation | Changed | Connected the Application installer microservice to Creatio. The microservice validates apps and packages for missing dependencies and compatibility issues before installation. The functionality is managed by the `AppsFeatures.UseAutoInstallDependencies` additional feature. Out of the box, "false."<br>More details<br>- If missing dependencies are detected and they exist in the Creatio Marketplace catalog, the microservice enriches the initial file by adding the required apps automatically.<br>- If compatibility issues or conflicting dependencies are found, the installation is blocked, and the platform provides detailed validation results to the user. |
| Advanced customization | Translations | Changed | Added functionality to override translations of core platform resources in Creatio. This change applies to static UI elements that were previously non-configurable through Creatio translation tools, such as the **Your profile** and **Exit** labels in the user profile menu, as well as back-end error messages such as incorrect login or password on the Creatio login page. To enable the functionality, contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) after upgrading the instance to version 8.3.1. This change enhances flexibility and supports more tailored localization. The functionality is available for Creatio in the cloud only. |
| Advanced customization | Translations | Changed | Added the "History of source files for core translations" (`SysTranslationRepository` code) object to store translations of core platform resources. This storage supports the generation of final localization artifacts used during deployment or export. Previously, the platform did not have a dedicated place to keep translated core resource files. Now, translated files can be stored systematically and reused or processed further to produce final localization artifacts. This change simplifies the translation workflow, improves organization. |
