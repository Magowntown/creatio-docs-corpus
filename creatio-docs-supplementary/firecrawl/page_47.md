A circular reference between packages, where the current package depends directly or indirectly on another package that, in turn, depends on the current package. This forms a closed loop of dependencies known as a **dependency chain**. Cyclic dependencies are problematic because they lead to runtime errors in Creatio apps. These errors can occur when applications attempt to access elements during execution that are not properly resolved due to the circular structure.

To prevent such issues, Creatio performs automatic checks when saving app changes:

- If a cyclic dependency is detected, Creatio allows saving the changes to the app but does not apply them and does not save the new package dependency.
- A notification is displayed, advising the user to review and correct the dependency setup.

Avoiding cyclic dependencies is essential for ensuring a stable and maintainable application architecture in Creatio. Learn more: [Cyclic connection chains in package hierarchy](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1624).
