Use Just-In-Time User Provisioning (JIT UP) function to avoid creating accounts for each separate service and to keep user database up-to-date. JIT UP extends the Single Sign-On (SSO) technology and helps to reduce the number of operations for administrating accounts and personal data in contact records. Each time a user logs on using SSO, the data on the contact page are updated with the data obtained from the identity provider (Fig. 1). If a user has no account in the Creatio, it can be created when the user logs in for the first time.
