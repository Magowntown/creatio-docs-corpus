## No-code platform [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/80-atlas-release-notes\#title-2228-1 "Direct link to No-code platform")

In the new generation of Creatio no-code platform, apps become the main building blocks for no-code developers. With Creatio, apps are now easier to build, manage, and customize.

### Application Hub [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/80-atlas-release-notes\#title-2228-2 "Direct link to Application Hub")

The Application Hub is a module for managing and orchestrating your applications at each stage of the development lifecycle. It enables users to design and launch new and configure existing applications, have a consolidated view of all available apps, connectors, and templates; manage instances and deployments, access available composable elements, and set up and facilitate the collaborative no-code development process.

Customers who have cloud production environments will receive email invites to the Application Hub and will be able to get started after updating to version 8.0 Atlas. Customers who have on-site production environments, as well as new Creatio users can sign up for the Application Hub in a couple of clicks. To register an organization in the Creatio Application Hub and get started, simply order a trial of any Creatio product. After the account is added, you will be able to create and set up apps or familiarize yourself with end-to-end marketing, sales, and service solutions integrated into our unified no-code platform.

Creatio Application Hub enables users to do the following:

- Create apps of any complexity in the No-Code Designer. Add processes, integrations, and set up custom UIs using drag-and-drop and interactive tooltips.

- Organize efficient team cooperation at the add-on setup and testing stage in an environment shared by analysts and developers.

- Invite your coworkers to collaborate in the application hub in a few clicks.
Invite users to the team

![Invite users to the team](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_8_0_0/app_hub_add_user.png)

- Set the team member permissions using the following roles:
  - **Administrator** has full access to the company's environments, as well as permissions to manage them. This role is responsible for user access management.
  - **Developer** has full access to development and testing environments, as well as trials ordered by the organization employees.
- Establish a unified view of the company's environments to organize app customization efforts.

- Switch between different environments in a few clicks without the need go through the login process every time. This is achieved with Creatio ID functionality based on the SSO mechanism. After you sign up for the Application Hub, you can open any site of your organization so long as you have permissions to access the site. When you log in to the site, Creatio automatically adds a user account linked to the main account in the Application Hub.

#### No-Code Designer [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/80-atlas-release-notes\#title-2228-5 "Direct link to No-Code Designer")

The No-Code Designer is a no-code development workplace that consolidates, simplifies, and elevates no-code app design tools. The No-Code Designer includes robust tools to create and modify pages and views, navigation items and sections, data models, workflows, and integrations in a single no-code workplace.

The No-Code Designer also provides advanced settings for professional development teams. It has intuitive navigation and allows no-code developers to have access to all required capabilities in a single place.

With the No-Code Designer, you can now create custom apps quicker and easier.

- Apps can include:
  - various custom UIs
  - business processes
  - dynamic cases
  - custom REST and SOAP service integrations
  - other schema types that are a part of Creatio configuration: objects, data binding, SQL scripts, etc.
- When you create an app, you can select a template that fits your solution the most, for example, a section with data and business processes, a dashboard page, etc.

- A package to which Creatio saves the developed functionality is added automatically when you create a new app. This dramatically streamlines the setup.

- When you work in Object, Freedom UI, Business Process, Case Designers, Creatio adds the required dependencies to the app automatically.

- When you save the app, Creatio identifies the relevant package automatically. If the app contains no available packages where the changes can be stored, Creatio adds a new package within the app automatically.

- When you edit an app created with Freedom UI, you can specify the general information: name, description, icon.

- When you edit apps, you can open the Section Wizard directly from the Designer to set up pages added in Creatio version 7.18.5 and earlier.


#### Freedom UI Designer [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/80-atlas-release-notes\#title-2228-6 "Direct link to Freedom UI Designer")

The Freedom UI Designer empowers no-code developers to build an interface of any type by enabling a maximum degree of freedom. The Freedom UI contains a library of predefined views, widgets, and templates to accelerate the design process.

The new version allows users to apply different UI themes and styles. The Freedom UI is fully adaptable to different screens and devices and complies with modern accessibility requirements.

- Page templates that you can add to the app to accelerate the setup process:


  - page with tabs and areas on the left
  - page with tabs and areas on the right
  - page with tabs and an area at the top
  - page with areas on the left
  - grid page
  - homepage
  - list page
  - blank page

Adding a page in the No-Code Designer

![Adding a page in the No-Code Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_8_0_0/gif_create_new_page_freedomui.gif)

- Besides fields, tabs, and areas, the Freedom UI Designer includes new UI customization tools:


  - label that serves as a heading of an individual section or page area
  - expansion panel that groups page elements
  - columns that group elements into blocks that have a predetermined layout
  - flex row and flex column that group elements horizontally or vertically without a layout
  - list that adds a list of another object's records based on the specified filters to the page
  - folder tree that lets you segment page records by setting up a folder hierarchy that has filters
  - folder management menu that lets you hide or show folders, as well as displays the selected folder if the folder tree is hidden on the page
  - action dashboard that displays case steps and subordinate tasks for users

Manage the element behavior and appearance in the settings panel. Click the element on the canvas to open the panel.

- App pages can accept one or more data sources. Creatio adds a data source automatically when you create an app. You can add an existing source or create a new source when you set up an app page.

- You can enable the following lookup field actions for users:
  - open a section or lookup whose data the field uses
  - add new values directly into the field
- You can setup placeholder text to display in input fields, for example, to explain how to fill out the field or specify the accepted data format.

- You can add various components, such as buttons or labels, to the "Folders" element header. This lets you add more functionality to complex components. For example, you can place a list and buttons that control the list data or additional actions inside the folder.
Setting up a folder

![Setting up a folder](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_8_0_0/gif_add_button_to_group_header.gif)

- It is now possible to set up the list view in the section and on record pages, for example:
  - manage filters and groups
  - set up static filtering
  - pin or hide columns
  - display the lookup field data as hyperlinks
  - sort records by clicking the column title
- You can add buttons to and manage button click actions in the Freedom UI pages. Besides standard actions that save and cancel changes or close the page, you can also select:
  - **Open new record**. Opens an add record page of the specified object. Available only for objects that have a section or record page detail. You can also set up the list of prepopulated fields on the add record page and specify their values.
  - **Open existing record**. Opens a specific Creatio page by a unique ID.
  - **Open specific page**. Opens a specific Creatio page implemented in Freedom UI and not bound to the current section or detail. After you select the page to open, the Designer displays the button that opens the editor of the specified page.
  - **Run process**. Launches the business process specified as part of the button setup. You can open the Process Designer to create a new process or edit the selected process directly from the button setup area.
- You can use icons in button captions. You can add an image to the button text or display only the icon to keep the design lean.
Setting up a button

![Setting up a button](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_8_0_0/gif_modify_button_freedomui.gif)
