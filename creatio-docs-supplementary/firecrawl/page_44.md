## Creatio platform [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-2-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-platform "Direct link to Creatio platform")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI and automation | AI Agents | Changed | Improved the AI Agent selection logic by sending contextual metadata, such as the current page location and visible fields, along with the user's initial message. This additional context helps the model to interpret user intent more accurately and select the most appropriate AI agent. Previously, Creatio selected AI Agents based only on the message text, which could result in misrouting in ambiguous cases. The enhanced approach improves selection precision, reduces routing errors, and increases the relevance and effectiveness of AI responses. |
| AI and automation | AI Agents | Changed | Renamed service agents to improve clarity and consistency of their display names. This change ensures AI Agent names are displayed in a clear and uniform format across the system.<br>More details<br>Renamed:<br>- "Case resolution agent" to "Case Resolution Agent"<br>- "Knowledge agent" to "Knowledge Agent" |
| AI and automation | AI Agents | Changed | Added support for generating interactive list widgets in the Creatio.ai chat panel. Users can request lists of specific records, such as top opportunities, key accounts, open cases, or new leads, and the AI Agent displays them as an interactive **List widget** component directly in the chat. This change enables quick access to business-critical data and improves the ability to review and interpret information without switching context.<br>More details<br>- Generated **List widget** components now support aggregation operations when interpreting natural-language queries.<br>- Added support for grouping records, counting items, summing numeric values, and generating ranked lists. This enables conversational analytical scenarios such as top agents by closed cases or top sales representatives by paid invoices.<br>These changes provide more effective data exploration without leaving the Creatio.ai chat. |
| AI and automation | AI Agents | Changed | Added support for displaying widgets directly in the Creatio.ai chat panel, including pipeline, sales pipeline, and full pipeline widgets. Users can describe the desired widget in natural language, and the AI Agent generates the corresponding widget interactively within the chat. This change provides fast, conversational access to visual analytics and improves data exploration without switching context. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Added support for referencing JSON schemas in AI API Skills through a full UI-based configuration. Users can now define, edit, and manage structured outputs directly on the skill page. The JSON schema is stored as a file within the file structure. JSON output generated by an AI API Skill must be parsed in a business process using a **Script task** element. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Changed the validation logic for links returned in Creatio.ai answers to ensure referenced records belong to objects that have an available and accessible record page. Creatio.ai now verifies each record reference before including it in answers. If no page is configured for the target object, the platform omits the link from the answer. This change prevents unusable links and ensures AI-generated answers include only valid, accessible links. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Improved the AI Skills that are used by the **Case Resolution Agent** and rely on the "Get Case External Messages" action to handle cases that have large email volumes more efficiently. The logic now trims email content before sending it to the model, processing only the most recent and relevant text while excluding quoted content and excessive symbols. This change reduces the amount of data processed by the AI model, improves summarization stability, and ensures consistent summaries regardless of case conversation size. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Changed the out-of-the-box values of the **Model** fields in the AI Skills used by the **Case Resolution Agent**. This change standardizes model selection across these skills, ensuring consistent behavior, predictable output quality, and improved action performance.<br>More details<br>Set the following values:<br>- "GPT-4.1" for "Summarize case," "Suggest case resolution," and "Case performance" AI Skills<br>- "GPT-4.1 mini" for "Check open cases" AI Skill |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Improved the "Case performance" AI Skill to recognize and include escalation events when generating reports. The skill now recognizes escalations between assignees, assignee groups, and support lines, and explicitly includes the escalation path in the summary. This change provides a more accurate and complete view of case handling and escalation history. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Improved the performance of the "Suggest case resolution" AI Skill by merging several article search steps into a single step. The skill now retrieves both case-linked and keyword-matched knowledge base articles simultaneously. This change reduces redundant prompt steps, improves stability, and provides more relevant article suggestions for case resolution. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Changed the out-of-the-box values of the **Model** fields in the AI Skills used by the **Knowledge Agent**. This change standardizes model selection across these skills, ensuring consistent behavior, predictable output quality, and improved action performance.<br>More details<br>Set the value to "GPT-4.1" for the "Create article" AI Skill. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Fixed | Fixed the issue where articles generated by the "Create article" AI Skill used by the **Knowledge Agent** bypassed the "Draft" stage when users did not manually set a status. The "Create open article draft" action now explicitly assigns the "Draft" status if none is specified, ensuring that generated articles follow the correct review and approval workflow before publication. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Changed the out-of-the-box values of the **Model** fields in the AI Skills used by the **Productivity Agent**. This change standardizes model selection across these skills, ensuring consistent behavior, predictable output quality, and improved action performance.<br>More details<br>Set the following values:<br>- "GPT-4.1" for "New meeting," "Reply to email," "Identify contacts" AI Skills<br>- "GPT-4.1 mini" for the "Summarize email" AI Skill |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Changed the out-of-the-box values of the **Model** fields in the AI Skills used by the **Creatio.ai Agent**. This change standardizes model selection across these skills, ensuring consistent behavior, predictable output quality, and improved action performance.<br>More details<br>Set the value to "GPT-4.1 mini" for the "Extend text," "Formal text rewrite," "Friendly text rewrite," "Rephrase text," "Shorten text," "Translate text" AI Skills. |
| AI and automation | AI Skills | Changed | Added the ability to enforce explicit and deterministic confirmation before running action from the Creatio.ai chat panel. When the **Require confirmation before start** checkbox on the **Settings** toggle panel of the action page is selected, users receive a confirmation question in chat asking for permission to launch the action. Out of the box, the checkbox is selected only for the new default way of creating records in sections or lookups. For all other new and existing actions, the checkbox is cleared. This change provides transparent control over action execution and reduces the need for scripted confirmation steps inside skills or agent prompts.<br>More details<br>The platform now uses the LLM to generate confirmation messages that include confirmation text, a confirm button, and a cancel button. The LLM forms the confirmation text based on the description and parameters of action. Users can confirm by pressing buttons or by entering a free-form response. Free-form confirmation requires an additional LLM call and therefore consumes a licensed action, while button-based confirmation consumes fewer actions and is executed faster. Generating the confirmation message itself also consumes an action but replaces scripted prompt sequences that previously increased action usage without providing a unified confirmation flow. Free-form confirmation was tested across thousands of message variations, although unusual mixed phrases or lengthy explanations might still complicate interpretation. |
| AI and automation | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Added support for connecting custom LLMs to the platform. Previously, the "LLM Model" (`LlmModel` code) object stored built-in provider models only. Based on this object, a new **Creatio.ai models** section that lets you configure external and custom LLMs was added. Users can now register models from OpenAI, Azure AI, and other providers including onsite-hosted models and use them in AI Agents and AI Skills alongside built-in provider options.<br>More details<br>- Added separate configuration pages for OpenAI, Azure, and custom LLM providers, each with its own form and provider-specific logic.<br>- Added the new virtual "CustomLlmModel" (`CustomLlmModel` code) object for custom providers. The object supports schemas, such as `CustomModelJson`, `CustomModelQueryExecutor`, `CustomModelEventListener`, and `CustomModel_FormPage`, enabling model parameters to be defined through a JSON field for a more flexible and extensible setup. |
| AI and automation | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Added a service listener to the "LLM Model" (`LlmModel` code) object to register new LLMs in the generative AI service automatically. This change ensures that new LLM configurations are registered and synchronized correctly with the generative AI service upon creation. |
| AI and automation | AI Agents,<br>AI Skills | Changed | Changed the default value of the "Max function calling count per Creatio.ai request" (`MaxFunctionCallingCountPerCopilotRequest` code) system setting from "25" to "50." This setting defines the maximum number of function-calling orchestrator calls that can be executed within a single LLM request for agents and skills relying on function calling. Increasing the default limit improves stability and enables successful execution of more complex, multi-step agents and skills without reaching the threshold of this system setting. |
| AI and automation | Actions | Changed | Added a new "Parse date/time" action that interprets natural-language expressions related to dates and times. The action accepts informal or conversational scheduling phrases and returns a normalized ISO-8601 result containing both UTC and local time zone values. When users provide inputs such as "tomorrow after lunch," Creatio.ai uses the new action to resolve the expression into a specific date for the next day and a local time of 13:00. This change improves natural-language understanding in automation scenarios and makes Creatio.ai more effective at processing conversational scheduling requests. |
| AI and automation | Actions | Changed | Added a universal default flow for creating records from the chat in the Creatio.ai chat panel. When a specialized AI Skill or Agent is not available to process a record creation request, the platform now falls back to a generic creation mechanism automatically. The platform determines the target object, retrieves metadata, validates user input against required fields and object-level business rules, and prompts the user for confirmation before performing the action. This change ensures reliable and consistent data entry even when specialized skills are unavailable.<br>More details<br>Added the following actions:<br>- "Create record default action" that provides a standardized fallback workflow for creating records.<br>- "Validate record before creation for object-level checks" that validates user input according to business rules before committing the data.<br>For both actions, certain technical limitations apply, including lack of support for "File," "Image," and "BLOB" type columns and a dependency on a deployed DataForge service. |
| AI and automation | Actions | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the "SearchEntities" action used by AI Skills failed during execution. The failure occurred at the **User task** element because the global search service was not initialized correctly. A new constructor was added to the "GlobalSearchService" (`GlobalSearchService` code) schema of the "Source code" type to accept a `UserConnection` parameter, and the "Search entities by query" (`SearchEntities` code) schema of the "User task" type in the `CrtCopilot` package was updated to pass the `UserConnection` from the `ProcessExecutingContext`, ensuring proper initialization. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved the behavior of the Creatio.ai chat panel to ensure messages are always sent to the correct chat context when a button that triggers an action is used. This change ensures consistent and intuitive interaction with Creatio.ai and displays Creatio.ai responses in the correct chat context.<br>More details<br>- If the panel is closed, a new chat is now created automatically, the predefined outgoing message, for example, "Explain the lead conversion probability score," is sent, and the panel opens so the user can view the conversation.<br>- If the panel is already open, the message is sent to the active chat. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Changed the visual styling of messages in Creatio.ai chat panel by removing the message bubbles to reduce visual clutter. This change makes AI responses more compact and easier to read, improving clarity and conserving space while clearly distinguishing AI messages from human interactions. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Added a timeout for displaying loading placeholders in the chat list and conversations of the Creatio.ai chat panel. Loading placeholders now appear only if loading takes longer than one second, reducing visual flicker during fast loads and improving the overall user experience. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Changed | Improved the layout of the rename mini page in Creatio.ai chat panel to improve usability on narrow screens and in embedded mode. The mini page now fits the chat panel width, keeps both action buttons visible, and supports multiline text in the **Title** field, enhancing accessibility and overall user experience. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed the issue where chat conversations in the Creatio.ai chat panel appeared empty when opened from search results if they contained messages with embedded dashboards, while opening the same chats from the chat list worked correctly. The updated loading logic now properly processes these messages, ensuring consistent and accurate rendering regardless of how the conversation is accessed. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed the internal link behavior in the Creatio.ai chat panel. Previously, all links, including internal links to Creatio sections, opened in a new browser tab. Internal links now correctly open in the current tab, while external links continue to open in a new tab. This change improves navigation consistency and overall usability within the Creatio UI. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed an issue that caused Freedom UI components in the Creatio.ai chat panel to render twice when reopening chats in expanded mode. Components such as metrics are now rendered only once, preventing duplicate backend requests and improving performance. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai chat panel | Fixed | Fixed an issue that caused message timestamps in Creatio.ai chat panel to ignore the user's time zone settings. The chat list and message threads now display timestamps consistently based on the time zone defined in the user profile, improving accuracy and usability. |
| AI and automation | DataForge | Changed | Changed the synchronization and lookup ingestion logic of the DataForge microservice to reduce load, accelerate data synchronization, and improve lookup data relevance. Previously, synchronization processed all records, even unchanged records, which degraded performance. The platform now detects and skips unchanged data, significantly reducing processing time and system load. Lookup synchronization also supports configurable inclusion/exclusion lists and batch ingestion with adjustable limits, improving scalability and data accuracy. This change delivers faster data availability, better startup and update performance, and more control over lookup handling, while maintaining full compatibility with existing integrations.<br>More details<br>- Updated the full synchronization pipeline.<br>- Enhanced lookup ingestion with batch processing and configurable whitelist/blacklist filtering for both startup and incremental synchronization. The blacklist filtering is managed by the **DataForge lookup sync exceptions** lookup. To manage the whitelist filtering, add the lookup based on the "DataForge lookup with unlimited values sync" (`DFSyncUnlimited` code) object.<br>- Added support for adjustable lookup parameters. The functionality is managed by the "DataForgeLookupRecordLimit" (`DataForgeLookupRecordLimit` code) system setting. Out of the box, "3,000."<br>- Added support for limiting records. The functionality is managed by the "DataForgeLookupRecordLimit" (`DataForgeLookupRecordLimit` code) system setting. Out of the box, "3,000."<br>- Added support for limiting chunk size. The functionality is managed by the "DataForge lookup chunk size" (`DataForgeLookupChunkSize` code) system setting. Out of the box, "1,000."<br>Added support for limiting maximum field length. The functionality is managed by the "DataForge lookup max field length" (`DataForgeLookupMaxFieldLength` code) system setting. Out of the box, "250." |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai add-ins | Changed | Added chat renaming functionality in the Creatio.ai chat panel for the Creatio.ai add-in for Microsoft Outlook and Teams. This change helps manage and revisit chats more effectively over time.<br>More details<br>You can now rename a chat from the chat list or from within an open chat via the **Actions** menu, available on pointer or keyboard focus for saved chats. The rename mini page sanitizes the current chat name automatically and requires at least one non-space character for the new name. After confirmation, the updated name appears in both the chat list and the chat header immediately. The rename option is hidden for unsaved "New chat" sessions. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai add-ins | Changed | Added support for Microsoft Teams theme alignment in the Creatio.ai add-in for Microsoft Outlook and Teams, enabling full visual consistency with the active Teams environment. The functionality is managed by the `DisableEmbeddedTheming` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. When enabled, the add-in detects the current Teams theme and is rendered in dark or light mode accordingly. The detection and rendering logic apply uniformly across all add-in instances, regardless of user, chat, browser, or platform. Previously, the add-in always used a static default theme. Now, it dynamically adapts to Teams theme changes in real time without requiring reloads, and the selected theme persists across add-in reloads. This change improves aesthetic integration and delivers a seamless, native-like experience across supported browsers and mobile platforms. |
| AI and automation | Creatio.ai add-ins | Changed | Fixed the issue where opening uploaded attachments in the Creatio.ai add-in for Microsoft Outlook and Teams returned a "401 Unauthorized" error. The `chat-file-message` component was rebuilt for compatibility with AI-embedded environments by replacing the native `<a href>` element with the `crt-link` component and a custom handler that invokes the `fileDownloadService`. This change resolves file-download issues in iframe-based scenarios used by embedded AI interfaces, while preserving existing behavior in standard Creatio environments. |
| No-code customization | Freedom UI Designer | Changed | Added support for real-time user presence indicators when working with a Freedom UI page and its related elements. Creatio now shows who is editing the page, its data sources, source code, or related object, displaying the user's name and avatar (if available). It also notifies users when others save changes to the same Freedom UI page. This change reduces conflicting edits and improves collaborative efficiency. |
| No-code customization | Freedom UI Designer | Changed | Added the ability to remove page data sources directly from the Freedom UI Designer. No-code creators can now delete unnecessary or unused data sources created within the same page schema, improving flexibility and reducing clutter in complex page configurations. The platform displays context-based confirmation messages: it notifies users when deleting linked objects that have unsaved changes, explains permanent deletion for unsaved objects, and blocks removal if the data source is still referenced elsewhere on the page. Previously, data sources added to a page could not be removed, which led to clutter and confusion during design. Now, users can manage page content more effectively by removing unnecessary data sources. This change enhances usability, ensures data integrity, and simplifies configuration management. |
| No-code customization | Translations | Changed | Added support for resilient translation mechanism with fallback logic. Previously, translations could fail to apply if embedded processes inside the object produced an error during save, which sometimes left localized content incomplete. The platform now separates the translation step from object-level business logic so translations are still applied even when object processes fail. This change ensures consistent localized content across environments and improves overall system resilience. |
| No-code customization | Translations | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the UI displayed mixed-language content in file system development mode after users changed the UI language on the **Basic settings** tab of the user profile page. The updated localization logic now correctly filters and displays resources only in the selected language, ensuring consistent multilingual behavior in development scenarios. |
| No-code customization | Data binding | Changed | Added consistent alphabetical sorting for data binding definitions by column names and localized resource keys to ensure predictable order regardless of the package import sequence. This change prevents irrelevant diffs in version control systems and enables reliable merging of binding and localization files. |
| No-code customization,<br>Schema management | No-code Designer,<br>Configuration section | Changed | Added support for filtering configuration schemas by the "Creatio.ai skill" type in the **Package settings** tab of the No-Code Designer and in the **Configuration** section. The type now has its own dedicated icon that is used in the **Type** drop-down list and in the section list. |
| No-code customization,<br>Schema management | No-code Designer,<br>Configuration section | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Modified by** field displayed "Supervisor" in the **Properties** window of the No-code Designer and **Configuration** section instead of the actual user after saving a schema. The field now correctly displays the user who made the change. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added validation that detects unresolved compilation errors before app installation. Creatio now displays a warning in the **Application installation** window when the most recent configuration compilation finishes with errors, informing users that such issues might affect installation. Users can still proceed with installation if all mandatory validations pass. The warning also includes a link to the **Configuration** section to help users navigate and resolve compilation errors quickly. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added content validation before installing apps and packages. Out of the box, validation is enabled only for environments whose "Environment type" (`EnvironmentType` code) system setting is set to "Pre-production" or "Production."<br>More details<br>After uploading the installation file and clicking the **Install** button in the **Application installation** window, validation runs during the "Checking app requirements before installation" stage. Creatio checks configuration schemas of the "Creatio.ai skill," "Source code," "Freedom UI page" of the "Client module," "Add-on," and "Object" types for references to parent schemas. For the "Data" type, Creatio validates that the corresponding object exists in the environment. If a required parent schema or the corresponding object for a "Data" type schema is missing or unavailable in the environment, Creatio blocks the installation and displays the **Content validation error** window that lists the problematic elements to help identify and resolve the issues before proceeding. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added file integrity validation as the initial step of the app installation process across all entry points, including the UI, WorkspaceConsole, and Clio utilities. Creatio now verifies the integrity of the installation file, for example, by using checksums, before executing any subsequent validations. If the file fails validation, Creatio displays an error message and stops the installation process. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added validation of missing dependencies, incompatibilities, and conflicts to the `InstallZipPackage` operation of the WorkspaceConsole utility and the `push-pkg` command of the Clio utility. These validations were previously available only when installing apps via Marketplace or file upload through Application Hub. This change ensures consistent validation across all installation methods. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added the "Go to Creatio Marketplace" tooltip to the hyperlink displayed in the list of apps in the **Application installation** window. This change clarifies the purpose of the link and enhances the user experience during app installation. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Changed stage descriptions displayed during app installation to improve clarity.<br>More details<br>Renamed:<br>- "Validation the app before installation" to Checking app requirements before installation"<br>- "Preparing" to "Starting app installation" |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added Google Analytics tracking to the **Application update** and **Application installation** windows as well as validation messages to improve visibility into user interactions during the installation process. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Added enhanced error handling and user feedback for issues that occur during app preparation by the Application installer microservice. Creatio now displays a dedicated **App preparation error** page when preparation fails due to package unavailability, missing session files, timeouts, or other internal errors. Detailed error information is written to the log file and can be downloaded directly from the error page. Creatio continues to wait for the preparation stage to complete according to the timeout settings defined in the "Web.config" configuration file before displaying the error page. This change improves transparency and simplifies troubleshooting of failed installations. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Changed | Removed the unused `HelpLink`, `OrderLink`, and `SupportEmail` properties from the "app-descriptor.json" file to simplify the file structure. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Fixed | Fixed the issue where uploading a \*.zip app archive whose name contains special characters caused a "500 Internal Server Error" from the Marketplace endpoint and returned the user to the upload page. Creatio now continues the app installation process and correctly displays the **Application installation** window even if the Marketplace endpoint fails. |
| Apps and packages | App management | Fixed | Fixed localization of the cancel button in the **Властивості застосунку** window in Ukrainian when renaming an app.<br>More details<br>Renamed "Скасувати пошук" to "Скасувати." |
| Apps and packages | App performance | Changed | Implemented automatic cancellation of long-running data queries to prevent potential performance degradation. Creatio now automatically stops queries that exceed the acceptable execution time, maintaining system responsiveness and stability. The acceptable query duration is managed by the "Data service client query timeout (milliseconds)" (`DataServiceQueryTimeout` code) system setting. Out of the box, "120000." |
| Apps and packages | Package management | Changed | Added deterministic alphabetical ordering for generated data in \*.csproj files to eliminate random or parasitic changes in version control systems. The "Core References," "Package References," and "Entity Files" sections are now sorted alphabetically to ensure consistent file generation and prevent unnecessary diffs. |
| Apps and packages | Package management | Fixed | Fixed a race condition in the `AddMetaDataInstanceToCache()` method that could occur in rare combinations of package content, configuration size, and environment parameters during package installation. The issue caused installation failures with errors such as "Error actualizing schema SomeSchemaName(Id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object." Additional validation checks were added to prevent this issue and ensure stable package installation. |
| Apps and packages | Package management | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the event sourcing mechanism that prevented package installation on environments where the database connection string is stored in a vault. Previously, the `NEventStore` library attempted to read the connection string from a configuration file and failed when packages contained data changes such as data bindings or installation scripts. The updated logic now correctly retrieves the connection string from the vault during installation, ensuring smooth deployment of packages across all supported infrastructure setups and preventing installation failures. |
| Apps and packages | Package dependencies | Changed | Updated the **Error while saving package dependencies** and **Cyclic dependencies detected** windows to help users better understand and troubleshoot cyclic dependency chains.<br>More details<br>- Changed the message in the **Error while saving package dependencies** window to "The changes were saved, but cyclic dependency chains were found in the package. A cyclic dependency occurs when elements in different packages reference each other directly or indirectly, creating a closed loop. Cyclic dependencies cannot be added automatically to your application's package and must be resolved manually. To fix this, move the related elements to a higher-level package or delete/replace the elements that cause the loop. After making the corrections, save the configuration again." The updated message provides a clearer explanation of the issue and guidance for resolving it.<br>- Added the "Element type," "Element that references," "Element being referenced," and "Package" columns to the **Cyclic dependencies detected** window. |
| Apps and packages | Package dependencies | Changed | Converted the `Custom` package into a regular package to simplify platform architecture, remove unnecessary dependencies, and eliminate cyclic dependency risks. The `Custom` package no longer automatically depends on newly created packages. Existing dependencies of the `Custom` package in existing environments remain unchanged for backward compatibility. |
| Apps and packages | Package dependencies | Changed | Deprecated the "Custom Package Id" (`CustomPackageUId` code) system setting. Functionality that previously relied on it, such as forecasts, campaigns, object permissions, and change log, was adapted to work regardless of this system setting. |
| Apps and packages | Package dependencies | Fixed | Fixed the issue where package dependency validation was skipped if the installed app had no declared dependencies in its "app-descriptor.json" file. Creatio now validates internal package dependencies correctly regardless of whether app-level dependencies are specified. |
| Freedom UI components | Button component | Changed | Added a new **Show notification for process start** checkbox to the **Action** parameter for the "Run process" action of the **Button** component in the Freedom UI Designer to comply with WCAG. The checkbox becomes available after you fill out the **Which process to run?** parameter. Out of the box, selected. It enables broadcasting of a LiveAnnouncer message whose text is specified in the new **Notification text** parameter, displayed when the process starts. The **Notification text** parameter appears after you select the **Show notification for process start** checkbox and has the "Process started" default value. |
| Freedom UI components | List component | Changed | Added support for managing folder-specific list settings with the same capabilities available for general list settings. Creatio now stores both folder-specific and general list settings in the `SysProfileData` database table. Existing folder-specific settings will be migrated automatically after updating the Creatio instance to version 8.3.2.<br>More details<br>- Renamed list actions:<br>  - **Save list settings for \[FolderName\]** to **Create custom settings  for \[FolderName\]**<br>  - **Save list settings for \[FolderName\]** to **Save as new default settings for \[FolderName\]**<br>- Added new list actions:<br>  - **Overwrite current settings for all users for \[FolderName\]**<br>  - **Restore default settings for \[FolderName\]**<br>Folder-specific list settings can be configured for all the folders where the user has read access. In this case, the settings apply to the user's personal view only. Overwriting or sharing settings with other users requires edit permissions for the folder.<br>When custom list settings for a folder are created for the first time, they are saved as personal settings for the current user. To apply them for all users, select **Save as new default settings for \[FolderName\]** list action. |
| Freedom UI components | List component | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the **List** component where data was not displayed in forward reference columns when the path matched the code of an existing column. For example, if an object contained a column whose code was `UsrContactMobilePhone`, the path `UsrContact.MobilePhone` did not display data correctly. |
| Freedom UI components | List component | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the Freedom UI Designer that occurred when creating a new object in the setup area of the **List** component. Previously, the entered object code was ignored, and an auto-generated code was used instead. The object is now created using the specified code, ensuring consistency and control during configuration. |
| Freedom UI components | List component | Fixed | Fixed an issue where related list filters that used the **Apply filter by page data** parameter value from the Freedom UI Designer setup area displayed incorrect records when relation criteria columns had undefined values. Previously, records from the related database table were shown even if the relation column in the main database table or filter criteria were undefined or inactive. The platform now correctly excludes unrelated records in such cases, ensuring data accuracy in related lists. |
| Freedom UI components | Feed component | Fixed | Fixed incorrect image rendering in the **Feed** component on .NET 8 instances. Previously, images appeared broken after upload due to an extra leading slash that produced an invalid URL. The updated logic now generates valid image paths, ensuring uploaded images are displayed correctly and restoring proper visual communication in feed messages. |
| Freedom UI components | Progress bar component | Fixed | Fixed an issue where a save modal window appeared unnecessarily in the Freedom UI Designer when configuring cases for the **Progress bar** component. The modal window is now displayed only when actual changes require confirmation, improving the overall UX. |
| Freedom UI components | Next steps component | Changed | Added support for the **Default value** property configured in the **General** property block of Object Designer for the "Category" (`ActivityCategory` code) column of the "Activity" (`Activity` code) object when creating a new activity from the **Next steps** component. This change ensures that the default value defined in Object Designer is now applied correctly during activity creation. |
| Freedom UI components | Search component | Changed | Added a tooltip to the **Search** component to clarify how the current search logic evaluates user input. The tooltip appears you point to or focus on the search field and explains whether the search matches values that start with or contain the entered text. The functionality is managed by the "String columns filter" (`StringColumnSearchComparisonType` code) system setting. Out of the box, "1." When the value is "1" or any value other than "0," the tooltip indicates "contains" matching. When the value is "0," the tooltip indicates "starts with" matching. The tooltip is fully localized and supplements the existing search hint without replacing it. |
| Freedom UI components | Summaries component | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the **Summaries** component that occurred when a summary was created in one language culture at design time and modified in another language culture at runtime. |
| Freedom UI components | Message composer component | Fixed | Fixed the issue where global styles were stripped from email templates when selected in the **Message composer** component, causing unintended formatting changes before sending. The issue occurred due to sanitization applied during template selection. The updated logic now inlines global and external CSS during template selection, ensuring styles are preserved and email templates keep their intended appearance. The functionality is managed by the `RichTextEditor.InlineStyles` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and enabled. |
| Freedom UI components | Message composer component | Changed | Changed the email recipient search logic in the **To** field of the **Message composer** component to improve reliability when using global search. This change ensures more accurate and consistent recipient selection. |
| Freedom UI components | Timeline component | Changed | Changed the logic of the **Enable live data update** checkbox in the **Behavior** property block of Object Designer for the objects that store feed messages or files displayed in the timeline. The functionality is managed by the `DisableLiveEditingFile` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and disabled. When disabled, the **Enable live data update** checkbox value at the parent object level, such as "Case" (`Case` code) or "Lead" (`Lead` code) objects, is used instead of file-related objects such as "Uploaded file" (`SysFile` code) or "Attachments and notes detail object in Cases section" (`CaseFile` code) objects. This change enables live update management at the section level to update the timeline automatically when files or comments are added. |
| Freedom UI components | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed an issue in the **Timeline** component where "Rich text" type fields displayed without the expected spacing. The timeline layout engine now correctly applies `colSpan` property value for "Rich text" type fields, ensuring proper spacing and alignment and improving overall readability. |
| Freedom UI components | Timeline component | Fixed | Fixed incorrect contact image rendering in the **Timeline** component for feed messages. Previously, contact photos were displayed inconsistently compared to the **Feed** component, resulting in distorted or improperly styled images. The updated rendering logic aligns timeline image behavior with the **Feed** component to ensure consistent styling, resolution, and visual clarity across the interface. |
| Freedom UI components | Timer component | Fixed | Fixed an issue with incorrect timer value calculation in the **Timer** component for long durations exceeding one year. This change ensures accurate computation and correct visual behavior for extended timer periods. |
| Freedom UI components,<br>Analytics | List component,<br>List widget component,<br>Template list component,<br>Expanded list component,<br>Approvals list component,<br>Data grid component,<br>Widgets | Changed | Changed the column code generation format for widgets and Freedom UI components that implement different list types. This change can affect custom components in lists if the configuration was registered in the `_designOptions.columns.cellViews` or `_designOptions.columns.editingCellViews` configuration objects in the source code of the Freedom UI page. To prevent potential issues, update the affected key names or re-add the columns in Freedom UI Designer.<br>More details<br>Column codes are still generated based on the column path and data source name, but now special characters in forward and backward references are handled differently. Instead of removing dots from the column path, the platform now replaces them with underscores. For example, if the data source is `PDS` and the column path is `Account.Name`, the generated code is `PDS_Account_Name`. |
| Freedom UI layout elements | Tabs layout element,<br>Toggle panel layout element | Changed | Added **Move up** and **Move down** options to the action menu of each tab in the **Tabs** and **Toggle panel** layout elements in the Freedom UI Designer to streamline reordering. Users can now change the tab order without deleting and re-adding tabs. |
| Freedom UI layout elements | Action dashboard layout element (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed an issue where email macros were not populated correctly when emails were sent from the **Action dashboard** layout element in Classic UI. This change ensures that macros are resolved properly during email composition. |
| Fields and inputs | "Image type" field | Changed | Improved accessibility of the "Image" type field to comply with WCAG 2.2. Creatio now populates the `alt` attribute automatically using the **Title** parameter value from the setup area when no value is provided and includes `aria`-labels for screen reader support. Previously, screen readers treated unlabeled images as generic elements without context. |
| Fields and inputs | "Rich text" type field | Fixed | Fixed an issue where "Rich text" type fields intermittently appeared empty despite containing saved content. This change addresses a client-side rendering failure caused by transient caching or initialization issues, which previously required a page reload or cache clearing to resolve. "Rich text" type fields now render their content consistently on first load, improving data visibility and user confidence. |
| Fields and inputs | "Dropdown" type field | Fixed | Fixed an issue where copying a configured "Dropdown" type field on a record page did not update dependent properties correctly. Previously, after changing the **Lookup** parameter value in the setup area of the copied field, the **Field value details**, **Supplementary display value**, and **Sort by column** parameters were not refreshed. These parameters are now reset automatically when the lookup source is changed, ensuring configuration consistency. |
| Analytics | Dashboards | Changed | Added the new **Dashboards** section in Freedom UI. The section provides a centralized view of dashboards similar to the Classic UI while being adapted to the modern layout and user experience of Freedom UI. The section was added to the "Sales," "Service," and "Contact center" workplaces. |
| Analytics | Dashboards | Changed | Changed the billing display logic in the **Creatio.ai dashboards** section to show AI Actions instead of tokens. The section now displays "Actions available" widget instead of "Tokens available." One AI Action corresponds to a single request sent to an LLM, providing a clearer and more intuitive understanding of AI resource consumption. The functionality is managed by the `GenAIFeatures.UseActionsForBilling` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and enabled. This change simplifies the user experience, aligns the billing model with how AI usage is measured in practice, and improves reporting clarity. |
| Analytics | Dashboards | Changed | Optimized the filter-building mechanism for dependent data sources used in complex widgets, reducing execution time for complex filters and accelerating data loading. This change enhances overall widget performance and provides a smoother, more responsive experience in Freedom UI dashboards. |
| Analytics | Widgets | Changed | Added support for manually configuring the order of chart series in widgets. Previously, users could not change the display order of series, and the order was applied automatically. Users can now reorder series directly in the Freedom UI Designer and Dashboard Designer using **Move up** and **Move down** options in the action menu for doughnut, bar, column, area, spline, line, scatter, and pipeline widgets. This change provides full control over chart presentation, enables aligning the series order with business logic or visual priorities, and improves overall clarity of data visualization without requiring additional permissions changes. |
| Business rules | Business rule management | Changed | Added the new "Value from another field" option for the "Set values" action in the Business Rule Designer. This change enables no-code creators to set a field value based on the value of another field within the same object or from related objects through forward references. The selection UX enables users to browse and select fields across multiple relationship levels. This simplifies dynamic field population and enhances rule configuration flexibility. |
| Business process setup | Formula element | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the **Formula** element in a business process failed to be executed correctly in localized environments due to incomplete translations of function names. Previously, this caused parsing errors, silent failures, or incorrect data type handling, for example, returning integers instead of decimals. This change ensures consistent formula execution and accurate error reporting across all supported languages. |
| Business process setup | Change access rights element | Fixed | Fixed the issue in the setup area for the **Change access rights** element that caused runtime errors when users duplicated configured access-rights elements within a business process. Previously, copying an element configured for one user to another resulted in incorrect internal reference handling in the duplicated element. The updated logic now handles internal references correctly, ensuring stable behavior when duplicating access-rights elements. |
| Business process setup | Call web service element | Fixed | Added support for custom error handling in the **Call web service** business process element. Previously, connectivity and system-level errors, such as timeouts, unreachable endpoints, or authentication failures, caused the business process to stop. Now, the element setup area includes a new **Continue execution on web service errors** checkbox. Out of the box, cleared. When selected, the business process continues to be executed even if the web service call fails or returns an error, and the element populates the existing **Success** and **Response body** output parameters with the relevant status and error details, enabling error-handling logic to be implemented directly within the process flow. The option applies only to newly created elements, preserving the behavior of existing processes and not overriding web service response errors that are already handled in the process logic. This change increases flexibility and fault tolerance in business process design. |
| Business process administration | Business process execution | Changed | Enhanced process execution logs. Logs now include detailed information about executed signals, gateways, and conditional flows, and support both compiled and interpreted processes. If a process element has no title, its code is displayed in the log instead. |
| Business process administration | Business process execution | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the platform ignored the maximum number of repetitions in business processes that included an intermediate timer event. Previously, processes with repetition limits continued looping indefinitely instead of terminating with an error as expected. |
| Integrations and APIs | OAuth authorization | Changed | Added support for OAuth 2.0 authorization on the .NET 8 platform, bringing it to functional parity with the .NET Framework version. The change enables both client credentials and authorization code grants in .NET 8 deployments, ensuring secure server-to-server and user-based integrations aligned with modern authentication standards.<br>More details<br>- Displayed the **OAuth integrated applications** section out of the box in the **Import and integration** block of the System Designer for both .NET Framework and .NET 8 instances.<br>- Updated the default value of the `OAuth20Integration` additional feature so that it is now registered and enabled. |
| Integrations and APIs | OAuth authorization | Fixed | Fixed the issue preventing the **OAuth integrated applications** section from loading when the `/api/OAuthHealthCheck` endpoint that verifies the health of OAuth functionality returned an invalid or malformed response. Updated logic allows the section to load even when the endpoint fails and provides diagnostic messages to help users identify and understand configuration issues. This change improves transparency, troubleshooting, and overall maintainability of OAuth integrations. |
| Integrations and APIs | OAuth authorization | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the OAuth returned incorrect HTTP status codes in certain error scenarios. The platform now returns "403 Forbidden" instead of "401 Unauthorized" when authentication succeeds but access is denied due to missing scopes, resources, or client definitions. This change is applied after upgrading the instance to version 8.3.2, ensuring accurate OAuth-compliant error handling and improving diagnostics and integration stability. |
| Integrations and APIs | OAuth authorization | Fixed | Fixed the issue that prevented multiple simultaneous OAuth client sessions for the same user. Previously, the OAuth authorization code grant blocked additional client connections when the same external app attempted to connect on behalf of the same user from another browser or device. The platform now supports parallel client sessions under the same user. The functionality is managed by the `IgnoreAccessSharedOnInTokenValidation` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and enabled. When disabled, a one-client-per-user restriction is enforced, and the platform now ignores milliseconds in token and access-sharing date comparison to prevent validation errors when tokens are issued within the same second. This change improves OAuth usability and flexibility, allowing users to connect the same app from multiple browsers or devices without encountering conflicts, while still giving administrators the option to enforce stricter session policies where required. |
| Integrations and APIs | Identity Service | Changed | Changed the ASP.NET Core version used in the Identity Service to 8.0.22 to ensure compatibility with the latest platform components and to incorporate recent security and performance improvements. This change keeps Identity Service aligned with the .NET 8 ecosystem and leverages the latest fixes and optimizations provided by the ASP.NET Core framework. |
| Integrations and APIs | Web services | Security | Improved the security of configuration and core web services by preventing exposure of technical details in error responses. Previously, these services could reveal stack traces when exceptions occurred. Creatio now replaces such responses with standardized generic messages to minimize technical information disclosure and ensure consistent, secure error handling. |
| Integrations and APIs | WebSockets | Fixed | Fixed the issue that caused multiple WebSocket reconnection attempts and unnecessary server load when the user session had already expired, and the WebSocket connection was lost. The platform now performs a single reconnection attempt for unauthenticated users. |
| Integrations and APIs | OData | Changed | Added support for working with files via OData 4 using a dedicated API. This enables CRUD operations for files, regardless of whether they are stored in the Creatio database or in an external file storage such as AWS S3. |
| Integrations and APIs | OData | Fixed | Fixed the issue where OData compilation was executed twice after configuration compilation, which could result in compilation errors during package or app installation. These errors disappeared only after full application recompilation. The OData compilation logic was corrected to ensure a single compilation pass, improving stability and preventing unnecessary installation errors. |
| Integrations and APIs | OData | Fixed | Fixed incorrect UTC date formatting in OData responses. Previously, OData returned date values converted to the user's local timezone but still appended the "Z" suffix, which incorrectly indicates UTC time. OData now returns all date values strictly in UTC and includes the "Z" suffix in compliance with the OData specification. The functionality is managed by the `EnableForceUseUtc` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and enabled for new environments on version 8.3.2 and later, and disabled for existing environments to preserve compatibility. This change improves data consistency and prevents misinterpretation in client apps consuming OData. |
| Integrations and APIs | Calendars | Fixed | Fixed an issue with recording invitation responses for meetings synchronized using Office 365 calendars when the meeting organizer was an external contact without calendar synchronization enabled in Creatio. This change ensures consistent and reliable processing of attendee responses regardless of organizer configuration. |
| Integrations and APIs | File processing (Classic UI) | Changed | Implemented file download validation in Classic UI to prevent incomplete or corrupted file retrieval. The backend now verifies whether the declared file size matches the actual uploaded size and returns a "422 Unprocessable Entity" error when the values differ. After upgrading the instance to version 8.3.2, Classic UI intercepts this response and displays a dedicated error message, preventing users from downloading incomplete files. The functionality is managed by the `DisableFileSizeValidationOnDownload` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and enabled. |
| Integrations and APIs | Emails | Changed | Changed the error message displayed in the **Emails** sidebar on the communication panel when the email server is unreachable. The updated message "The email server is unreachable. This may be caused by network configuration issues, DNS problems, or temporary mail server unavailability. Please contact your network administrator to resolve the issue." provides clearer diagnostics and helps users better understand the root cause of the issue. |
| Integrations and APIs | Emails | Fixed | Fixed an issue where users without administrative permissions were unable to add an image to the email signature on the mailbox settings page. This change ensures that access rights are applied correctly, allowing non-administrative users to insert images into their signatures. |
| Integrations and APIs | Emails sending | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the email page could freeze after a user sent a long email. This change ensures that the UI responds correctly after sending lengthy messages and prevents the page from becoming unresponsive. |
| Integrations and APIs | Event processing | Changed | Added a public API to handle granular change events in view model collections (`BaseViewModelCollection`). Previously, collection change listeners only indicated that a change occurred without providing details. The new API supports event handling for collection-level updates as well as item additions, removals, index shifts, and attribute changes within individual items, eliminating the need for manual snapshots and comparisons entirely. |
| Code-based customization | Object Designer | Changed | Added the ability to configure a list of objects for which record deletion must be logged. You can retrieve this list through a dedicated API. The deletion log works independently of the object change log configuration, and logging can be enabled without restarting the instance or triggering compilation. |
| Code-based customization | Data types | Changed | Extended the collection of available data types with the "Decimal(0)," "Currency(0)," "Currency(1)," and "Currency(3)" types. This change improves flexibility when modeling numeric and currency values and provides better support for currencies such as Japanese yen, which require zero decimal places. |
| Code-based customization | Quartz task scheduler | Fixed | Fixed an issue where ThreadPool configuration settings were not consistently applied to the WebApp component. Previously, the minimum ThreadPool worker threads (`ThreadPoolWorkerThreads`) and IOCP threads (`ThreadPoolCompletionPortThreads`) were configured only during loader startup. If WebApp started after the loader had completed initialization, it continued using default ThreadPool values instead of the configured values. The startup logic now ensures that both loader and WebApp explicitly apply the configured `ThreadPoolWorkerThreads` and `ThreadPoolCompletionPortThreads` values during their own initialization, providing consistent threading behavior regardless of component startup order. |
| Code-based customization | Database operations | Fixed | Fixed incorrect generation of `UpdateSelect` queries. In some cases, `UpdateSelect` queries were formed incorrectly when they included joins with parameters. The query generation logic was updated to ensure proper handling of joins and parameterized conditions. |
| Schema management | Configuration section | Changed | Extended logging for database schema actions, providing detailed visibility into operations that were previously logged only on failure. The platform now records descriptive information about generated and executed database actions, including all generated schema captions and SQL scripts with execution time during execution. This change helps support teams analyze schema-related issues without involving the development team.<br>More details<br>Extended logging applies to actions such as app and package installation, Object Designer usage, and database structure updates, regardless of where these actions are performed.<br>The functionality is managed by the following additional features:<br>- `EnableAddedSchemaDbActionsDetailedLogInWsC`. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled.<br>- `EnableSchemaDbActionExecutedLogInWsC`. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled.<br>- `EnableSchemaDbActionsDetailedLog`. Out of the box, registered and enabled. |
| Schema management | Configuration section | Changed | Improved array structure for schema metadata. Each array item is now stored on a separate line instead of the previous single-line format. This change enables convenient and accurate metadata merging using standard version control tools and maintains backward compatibility with the previous format. |
| Schema management | Configuration section | Changed | Changed the `SchemaManager` initialization logic to improve reliability when the first initialization attempt fails. The updated behavior detects transient database unavailability, such as temporary network issues, and retries `SchemaManager` initialization on subsequent requests instead of causing app unavailability. This change significantly improves platform resilience and stability, especially in environments prone to temporary infrastructure disruptions. |
| Schema management | Schema inheritance | Changed | Improved the mechanism for generating metadata differences when saving replaced schemas. Previously, the platform compared replacements of the same schema across parallel package hierarchies, which could produce unrelated or excessive changes in the metadata diff. The diff is now generated strictly by comparing the current schema with its direct parent, ensuring that only relevant modifications are included. |
| Schema management | Schema inheritance | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the generated source code for the "Folder – Administration object (view)" (`VwGroupSysAdminUnit` code) object schema incorrectly referenced itself instead of its parent "System administration object" (`SysAdminUnit` code) object schema. This caused dependency breakage and compilation failures, especially when the replacement of the `SysAdminUnit` schema was moved. This change adds the missing D8 metadata attribute to ensure correct parent resolution. The updated metadata is generated after re-saving the object, restoring proper schema inheritance and stable class generation. |
| Schema management | Environment schemas | Changed | Added support for managing replaced environment schemas of the "Object" type directly from the **Configuration** section. Users that have the "System administrators" role can now view these schemas, open their metadata and properties, and delete them, while restricted schema operations are explicitly blocked to preserve platform integrity and prevent unintended modifications. |
| Data models | Database management | Fixed | Fixed the default sorting behavior by the `Id` column in PostgreSQL. Previously, Creatio added sorting for pagination automatically, and PostgreSQL used `"Id" ASC NULLS FIRST` as the default order, while the index was built as `"Id" ASC NULLS LAST`. This mismatch caused additional sorting operations. The platform now uses `"Id" ASC NULLS LAST` as the default, matching the index and improving query performance. |
| Data models | Database management | Changed | Replaced the custom PostgreSQL instance used by the database enrichment service with the official PostgreSQL Helm Chart. This change addresses identified security vulnerabilities and standardizes deployment using a supported PostgreSQL distribution. |
| Data models | Data model attribute | Changed | Added support for schema-defined custom value converters in calculated attributes. This change enables developers to apply reusable and modular transformation logic directly in attribute definitions, improving consistency and maintainability of data processing. |
| Data models | Data model attribute | Fixed | Fixed attribute update handling by creating an isolated deep copy of the previous attribute value before comparison, ensuring that the `areValuesEqual()` method correctly identifies changes in referenced objects. This change improves accuracy of change detection for complex attribute types and prevents update issues caused by shared references. |
| Security settings | Platform cookies | Changed | Renamed platform cookies to remove legacy "BPM" identifiers and align with the new Creatio naming convention. Additionally, added a backward compatibility mechanism that supports both legacy and new cookie names during the transition period. The backward compatibility mode will be deprecated and disabled in upcoming releases. We will provide a prior notification at least one release before disabling backward compatibility. After deprecation, only the new cookie names will be used. Update custom integrations that rely on legacy cookie names to use the new naming convention to prevent potential issues after the transition period.<br>More details<br>- Renamed the following platform cookies:<br>  - BPMCSRF to CRT\_CSRF<br>  - BPMLOADER to CRT\_LOADER<br>  - BPMSESSIONID to CRT\_SESSIONID<br>- Implemented the following:<br>  - Automatic mapping between legacy and new cookies on incoming requests when legacy cookie transformation is enabled.<br>  - Returning of legacy cookies when the server creates new cookies if backward compatibility mode is enabled.<br>  - Usage of cookie names defined in the "Web.config" file located in the root Creatio directory for all backend operations. |
| Logging tools | Change log | Changed | Improved the logic for configuring the object change log through the **Change log** section. The platform now ensures that administrator-defined change log settings have the highest priority, even if the same object is replaced in other packages.<br>More details<br>- When the change log property of an object or the list of logged object columns is modified in the **Change log** section, the platform automatically creates a replaced environment schema of the "Object" type that overrides only the change log–related properties.<br>- If such an environment schema exists, its change log settings take precedence regardless of the package hierarchy and are always applied.<br>- If the environment schema is deleted, the standard object hierarchy rules apply. |
| Logging tools | Change log | Changed | Prohibited enabling the change log for the "User session" (`SysUserSession` code) object schema, since this object already represents a log of user sessions and enabling additional change tracking would lead to significant performance issues. No logging tables are generated even if the change log is configured for this object. |
| User and access management | Licensing | Changed | Added license control for integrating custom AI models. Previously, users could integrate custom models without licensing restrictions. Now a corresponding product license is required to enable external and custom model integration. This change aligns the platform with the updated pricing model and gives administrators better control over how AI models are used within the environment.<br>More details<br>Added the `CreatioAIModels.CreatioNonDefaultProviders.Use` and `CreatioAIModels.CustomProviders.Use` licensed operations to regulate access to external and custom AI model providers. These operations determine whether to connect AI models from OpenAI, Azure, or other third-party providers. Without the required license, the" Bring Your Own Model" capability is disabled. |
| User and access management | Licensing | Fixed | Fixed the issue where automatic license redistribution was not triggered for regular users logging in through OAuth, for example, in external access scenarios. |
| User and access management | User management | Fixed | Fixed the issue where newly invited users from the "All external users" roles could access Freedom UI pages before setting their password. Previously, the registration link from the invitation email opened a password change page embedded in the Creatio, unintentionally exposing the navigation panel and available sections. The registration link for external users now opens as a standalone page, consistent with the password recovery process. The functionality is managed by the `UseOldPortalInviteLinkGeneration` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. This change prevents access to the portal UX until a password is set, improving access control and aligning onboarding with security standards. |
| User and access management | Technical users | Changed | Added the new "Creatio ResKit utility" technical user for use by the ResKit CLI utility during core resource generation operations, simplifying access management and improving auditability of CLI interactions with the platform. The technical user enables secure and consistent generation of custom core resources and supports saving the source Excel file to Creatio for use during subsequent re-generation cycles. This change ensures stable, predictable, and repeatable resource generation and contributes to a more maintainable and transparent development workflow. |
| User and access management | Technical users | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the UI incorrectly displayed full access to system objects when creating a technical user. Previously, the interface displayed full object access during user creation and corrected the permissions only after the user was saved, which might have misled administrators or caused configuration errors. The updated logic now displays the correct empty permission list immediately during user creation, ensuring transparency and accurate access configuration. |
| User and access management | Access rights | Changed | Added additional access check in the `GetRecordRights()` method of the "Records permissions page service" (`RightsService` code) schema of the "Source code" type. The updated logic now returns record rights only when the user has read access to the corresponding record, ensuring consistent and secure access-control behavior. |
| User and access management | Access rights | Changed | Restricted edit permissions for the "Edit pages in UIs by object" (`EntityEditPagesUITypes` code) object in the **Object permissions** section. Only users that have the "System administrators" role can now modify records, while users that have the "All employees" and "All external users" roles have read-only access to improve configuration security. |
| User and access management | Access rights | Changed | Improved the logic that overrides permission attributes for objects through the **Object permissions** section. Administrator-defined permission settings now always take precedence, even when the same object is replaced in other packages. When the **Use column permissions**, **Use record permissions**, or **Use operation permissions** setting is changed on the **Permissions** tab of the object page in the **Object permissions** section, Creatio adds a replaced environment schema that is placed last in the hierarchy automatically. This schema overrides only the modified setting while preserving all other properties from higher-level packages. If such a replaced environment schema already exists, its permission settings continue to take priority. If it is removed, the standard package hierarchy rules apply again. |
| Administration | Access permissions | Changed | Restricted the ability to create and delete records in the "Installed application" (`SysInstalledApp` code) and "Package in installed application" (`SysPackageInInstalledApp` code) objects. These operations are now permitted only for users that have the "System administrators" role to ensure tighter control over app installation metadata and maintain system integrity. |
| Authentication | 2FA | Fixed | Fixed the issue that prevented users that have the "All external users" role from disconnecting the authenticator app on the user profile page. |
| Authentication | OpenID authentication | Fixed | Fixed the issue where user switching on the OAuth consent page behaved incorrectly in environments that use OpenID authentication. The updated logout and redirection logic now performs a proper sign-out and returns users to the login page instead of redirecting them to the runtime. This ensures consistent and secure behavior across trial instances and other SSO-connected environments. |
| Authentication | Passwords | Fixed | Fixed the inconsistency in username handling during the password reset process. Previously, the **Username** field was case-sensitive only during password reset, while regular login treated usernames as case-insensitive. Usernames are now processed in a case-insensitive manner in both scenarios. |
| Creatio maintenance | Classic UI shell | Deprecated | Announced official discontinuation of Classic UI shell. All environments still using the Classic UI shell will be automatically switched to the Freedom UI shell during the upgrade to version 8.3.2. No additional configuration will be required on your side. This change affects panels, navigation, communication areas, and related elements only. All existing functionality, including Classic UI sections, will remain unaffected and continue to work as before. |
| Creatio maintenance | Creatio version update | Changed | Changed the Creatio platform to use Angular 18, ensuring compatibility with the latest Angular framework standards and avoiding reliance on removed or unsupported APIs. This change improves long-term platform stability and aligns the product with modern front-end development practices. |
| Creatio maintenance | Creatio version update | Changed | Updated Creatio to use Angular Material library version 18. During the upgrade, several internal Material CSS classes used in the `mat-dialog` component were changed due to the transition to MDC-based components.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-dialog-container` with `mat-mdc-dialog-container`<br>- `mat-dialog-actions` with `mat-mdc-dialog-actions`<br>- `mat-dialog-title` with `mat-mdc-dialog-title` |
| Creatio maintenance | Creatio version update | Changed | Updated Creatio to use Angular Material library version 18. During the upgrade, several internal Material CSS classes used in the `mat-snackbar` component were changed due to the transition to MDC-based components.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-snack-bar-container` with `mat-mdc-snack-bar-container`<br>- `mat-simple-snack-bar` with `mat-mdc-simple-snack-bar`<br>- `mat-simple-snackbar-action` with `mat-mdc-snack-bar-action` |
| Creatio maintenance | Creatio version update | Changed | Updated Creatio to use Angular Material library version 18. During the upgrade, several internal Material CSS classes used in the `mat-tab-group` component were changed due to the transition to MDC-based components.<br>More details<br>Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>- `mat-tab-group` with `mat-mdc-tab-group`<br>- `mat-tab-nav-bar` with `mat-mdc-tab-nav-bar`<br>- `mat-ink-bar` with `mdc-tab-indicator`<br>- `mat-tab-label-content` with `mdc-tab__content`<br>- `mat-tab-label` with `mat‑mdc‑tab`<br>- `mat-tab-label-active` with `mdc-tab--active`<br>- `mat-tab-body-wrapper` with `mat-mdc-tab-body-wrapper`<br>- `mat-tab-header` with `mat-mdc-tab-header`<br>- `mat-tab-list` with `mat-mdc-tab-list`<br>- `mat-tab-labels` with `mat-mdc-tab-labels`<br>- `mat-tab-label-container` with `mat-mdc-tab-label-container`<br>- `mat-tab-header-pagination` with `mat-mdc-tab-header-pagination`<br>- `mat-tab-header-pagination-before` with `mat-mdc-tab-header-pagination-before`<br>- `mat-tab-header-pagination-after` with `mat-mdc-tab-header-pagination-after`<br>- `mat-tab-header-pagination-controls-enabled` with `mat-mdc-tab-header-pagination-controls-enabled` |
| Creatio maintenance | Creatio version update | Changed | Updated Creatio to use Angular Material library version 18. During the upgrade, several internal Material CSS classes used in the `mat-input` component were changed due to the transition to MDC-based components.<br>More details<br>- Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>  - `mat-input-element` with `mdc-text-field__input`<br>  - `mat-input-wrapper` with `mat-mdc-text-field`<br>  - `mat-input-prefix` with `mat-mdc-form-field-icon-prefix`<br>  - `mat-input-suffix` with `mat-mdc-form-field-icon-suffix`<br>- Refactored internal DOM structure to align with the Material Design Components (MDC) specification.<br>  <br>- Updated custom styles targeting deprecated Material CSS classes.<br>  <br>- Updated ripple and floating label behaviors to use full MDC-compliant implementation. |
| Creatio maintenance | Creatio version update | Changed | Updated Creatio to use Angular Material library version 18. During the upgrade, several internal Material CSS classes used in the `mat-form-field` component were changed due to the transition to MDC-based components.<br>More details<br>- Replaced CSS classes as follows:<br>  - `mat-form-field` with `mat-mdc-form-field`<br>  - `mat-form-field-wrapper` with `mat-mdc-form-field-wrapper`<br>  - `mat-form-field-flex` with `mat-mdc-form-field-flex`<br>  - `mat-form-field-label` with `mdc-floating-label`<br>  - `mat-form-field-underline` with `mdc-line-ripple`<br>  - `mat-form-field-subscript-wrapper` with `mat-mdc-form-field-subscript-wrapper`<br>  - `mat-form-field-infix` with `mat-mdc-form-field-infix`<br>  - `mat-form-field-hint` with `mat-mdc-form-field-hint`<br>  - `mat-error` with `mat-mdc-form-field-error`<br>- Refactored internal DOM structure to align with the MDC Web specification.<br>  <br>- Updated custom styles targeting deprecated Material CSS classes.<br>  <br>- Updated ripple and floating label behaviors to use MDC-based implementation. |

| Creatio maintenance | Cache clearance | Changed | Added a new "Cache management" action group to the **Actions** drop-down list in the **Configuration** section. The action group includes the **Clear IndexedDB cache for all users** item that lets administrators clear browser cache storage for all users. This change helps resolve issues caused by outdated or corrupted cached data across user sessions and ensures consistent platform performance. |
| Administration | Caching | Changed | Added support for client-side caching using IndexedDB for system settings, additional features, and access rights to improve page load performance. Previously, the client repeatedly requested these values from the server, increasing load times. The new caching mechanism reduces redundant requests and improves responsiveness. The functionality is managed by the `DisableSystemClientCache` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and enabled. |
| Administration | Caching | Fixed | Fixed the caching logic for API requests executed on behalf of technical users, eliminating performance degradation when accessing objects that do not use operation-based administrative checks. This change corrects inefficient server-side caching behavior that previously caused unnecessary permission-evaluation overhead for such objects. With the optimized caching mechanism, API operations, such as OData and DataService requests, are executed faster and more consistently across all scenarios that involve technical users. |
| Administration | Data synchronization | Changed | Added support for referral chasing in LDAP synchronization to improve compatibility with multi-server LDAP environments. Previously, referral chasing was disabled out of the box and could not be modified, limiting synchronization to a single LDAP server. The functionality is managed by the new "LDAP referral chasing mode" (`LDAPReferralChasingOptions` code) system setting. Out of the box, "None." The system setting lets administrators configure the desired referral chasing behavior, enabling the system to follow LDAP referrals and retrieve user data from additional directory servers when required. This change increases flexibility and suitability for complex enterprise infrastructures with distributed directory services. |
| Administration | Timezones | Changed | Changed the Kazakhstan timezone from GMT+06:00 to GMT+05:00 to ensure correct time calculations and alignment with the updated regional standard. |
| UX | Page performance | Fixed | Fixed an issue where pages opened from the notification panel were not displayed as modal windows. Previously, such pages opened in full-page view instead of the expected modal format. |
| UX | Page performance | Changed | Improved page opening and reopening performance by optimizing the execution of the `GenerateViewModelScript` query that runs during each page load. Updated logic significantly reduces processing overhead, resulting in faster page rendering and a more reactive user experience. The functionality is managed by the `DisableGenerateViewModuleScriptOptimization` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. |
| UX | Page performance | Fixed | Fixed the issue where a console crash occurred when users navigated back from a record page to the section before the page finished loading. Previously, the platform continued executing `viewModel` operations after the `viewModel` was disposed. This change prevents operations on destroyed `viewModels`, improving UI stability during navigation. |
| Accessibility | Screen reader support | Changed | Added screen reader announcements for loading masks during navigation, record saving, and business process execution to comply with WCAG. This change provides real-time feedback to users that have visual impairments and enhances accessibility during UI transitions.<br>More details<br>- Integrated the `LiveAnnouncementService` service to announce specific messages when loading masks appear and disappear.<br>  <br>- Added the following announcements:<br>  - "Loading, please wait..." and "Loading is completed" during page navigation<br>  - "Saving, please wait..." when saving records<br>  - "Starting a process, please wait..." when launching a business process. |
| Communication | Chats | Changed | Added support for translating incoming messages in omnichannel chats using Creatio.ai-powered translation. When a client starts a chat, the platform automatically detects the client language, displays it in the **Chats** sidebar of the communication panel, and allows chat agents to translate messages into the language specified on the **Basic settings** tab of the user profile page or another target language selected in the chat header. After the agent clicks the **Translate** button, all subsequent messages in the conversation are translated automatically. This change eliminates the need for external translation tools, speeds up agent response times, and improves the quality of multilingual communication between agents and customers.<br>More details<br>Chat translations rely on the following AI API Skills:<br>- "Language detector" that identifies the primary language of a text and returns it as a BCP-47 locale code. For example, "en-US."<br>- "Translate text" that translates the input text into a target language specified by a BCP-47 locale code, for example, "en-US," automatically detecting the source language when not provided. The skill preserves meaning, tone, terminology, and does not alter proper names, email addresses, code fragments, and similar content. |
| Communication | Chats | Changed | Added functionality that manages chat translation for chat agents to the **Chats** sidebar of the communication panel. The functionality is managed by the new "Enable chat translation" (`EnableChatTranslation` code) system setting. Out of the box, "false."<br>More details<br>When set to "true," the platform activates all translation-related UI components as well as the logic for automatic language detection, enabling chat agents to translate incoming messages into their preferred language using Creatio.ai-powered capabilities. |
| Communication | Chats | Changed | Added support for preserving and retranslating messages in transferred chats on the **Chats** sidebar of the communication panel. This change ensures continuity and clarity in multilingual conversations across chat transfers.<br>More details<br>- Displayed previously translated messages to the new agent during chat reassignment. If the new agent's language matches the translation language used in the transferred chat, all translated messages remain visible. Otherwise, messages from the parent chat(s) are shown in their source form.<br>- Added the ability for agents to select a different translation language in the chat header and click the **Translate** button to retranslate all messages from the parent chat(s).<br>- Provided a "Show original" option for translated messages and a "Translate" option for untranslated messages. |
| Communication | Chats | Changed | Added support for managing the visibility of the translation panel in the chat header on the **Chats** sidebar of the communication panel. Out of the box, the panel is shown when a new chat starts. Chat agents can control its visibility using the **Hide translation panel** / **Show translation panel** toggle button. The button name changes depending on the current state of the translation panel. This change provides better control over the chat layout and lets agents simplify the interface when translation features are not needed. |
| Communication | Chats | Changed | Added support for translating messages from previous chats directly in the **Chats** sidebar of the communication panel. Agents can translate historical messages using the **Translate** button, view them in the target language selected in the chat header, and toggle back to the original content using **Show original** button. This change improves clarity and support quality in multilingual multi-session and transferred chats. |
| Communication | Chats | Changed | Added support for translating outgoing chat messages to improve multilingual communication between chat agents and customers. Agents can now translate their responses manually or automatically before sending, depending on platform configuration. Translation behavior is managed by the "Automatically translate outgoing messages" (`AutoTranslateOutgoingMessages` code) system setting. Out of the box, "false," allowing agents to use the **Translate** button in the message editor to manually convert their response into the customer language defined in the chat header and to revert to the original text by clicking the button again.<br>More details<br>When set to "true," outgoing messages are translated automatically upon sending, and the **Translate** toggle appears active out of the box. Agents can still override automatic translation for individual responses using the "Send without translation" option, ensuring full control over translation behavior. |
| Communication | Chats | Fixed | Improved the issue handling logic for "Telegram" chat channels in the `OmnichannelMessageHandler` request handler to reduce performance impact and improve visibility for administrators. Issues caused by duplicate "Telegram" chat channels are now logged only once per application pool recycle, and administrators receive a notification in the notification panel and on the **Chat settings** page indicating that the channel is not receiving messages. This change prevents excessive logging, avoids performance degradation, and provides clearer guidance for resolving configuration issues. |
| Communication | Chats | Fixed | Fixed incorrect links in the **Chats** sidebar of the communication panel when no chat channels were configured. Previously, clicking the link opened the **Chat settings** page in Classic UI. Creatio now opens the **Chat settings** page in Freedom UI instead. Updated links to Academy articles to point to the latest documentation version. |
| Communication | Chats | Fixed | Fixed the incorrect handling of chat agent statuses across multiple devices. Previously, agents logged in to both Creatio Mobile and Creatio web were marked as "Inactive" when logging out from the mobile app, even if they remained active on another platform. The updated business logic now tracks statuses independently for each active session to ensure chat availability accurately reflects the actual activity of the agent and prevents unintended status changes in multi-device workflows. |
| Communication | Chats | Fixed | Fixed the issue on the chat page where images opened in full size from conversations were not displayed completely. Images are now displayed in full size without cropping or truncation. |
| Communication | Chats | Fixed | Fixed the issue where users in the "All employees" role could retrieve chat messages without sufficient access rights through the `OmnichannelChatService` schema of the "Source code" type. The service now validates record-level access rights before returning conversation data, ensuring that only users that have corresponding access rights to the chat record can access chat content and enhancing conversation protection. |
| Communication | Chats | Fixed | Removed unused code in the `GetChatConversation()` method in the `ChatRepository` schema of the "Source code" type within the `OmnichannelMessaging` package. Previously, the method invoked `BuildConversation()` without using its result, leaving redundant and misleading logic in place. This change eliminates unused call while preserving runtime behavior, improving code clarity and maintainability for future work with omnichannel messaging components. |
| Communication | Message templates | Changed | Added support for applying localized message templates based on the language of the current chat.<br>More details<br>- When chat translation is enabled and the **Detected language** field for the conversation is populated, the platform applies templates in that language if localized versions are available.<br>- When chat translation is disabled or the **Detected language** field is empty, the template language falls back to the language specified in the **Preferred language** field on the **Contact info** tab of the contact page (previous behavior).<br>- AI Agents can preview the list of available templates in the primary language (English). When a template is selected, the localized version is inserted into the chat input if it exists.<br>- Templates that already exist in the selected language are not auto-translated on send. The functionality is managed by the new "Automatically translate outgoing messages" (`AutoTranslateOutgoingMessages` code) system setting. Out of the box, "false." When set to "true," AI Agents can still use the **Translate** button to manually translate the message before sending, ensuring precise control over multilingual communication. |

## Creatio products and apps [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-2-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-products-and-apps "Direct link to Creatio products and apps")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creatio Sales | Territory Management | Added | Added a new **Territory management** composable app supporting territory structuring and related operations within Sales Enterprise Creatio products. The app was added to a new "Territory management" workplace, built as part of composable app strategy and registered within the internal ecosystem to support automated CI/CD processes.<br>More details<br>- The section page includes the following tabs:<br>  - **Territories**. The tab displays all active territories in a hierarchical structure. Each territory includes general information as well as key KPIs. This view helps users assess territory structure and performance directly from the list page. Inactive territories are excluded from the view.<br>  - **Accounts**. The tab displays accounts assigned to the selected territory and all its descendants. The list remains read-only to ensure data integrity. The tab supports filtering by industry, tier, type, and country.<br>  - **Analytics**. The tab displays aggregated KPIs for accounts within the selected territory and all its descendants. The tab provides a visual overview of account distribution and performance across the territory hierarchy.<br>The section page supports list and dashboard views. The out-of-the-box "Territory management analytics" dashboard provides a visual summary of key KPIs using widgets and charts, enabling users to quickly assess territory coverage, account distribution, and pipeline metrics. The section page refreshes the territory hierarchy automatically after CRUD operations, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.<br>- The territory page includes the following tabs:<br>  - **Overview**. The tab provides a summarized view of key KPIs and the subordinate territory structure. It displays core metrics and a list of child territories. This enables quick assessment of territory performance and hierarchy without switching modules.<br>  - **Team**. The tab displays contacts linked to the territory assigned to the current account. Users can add or remove contacts from a predefined list, and the tab indicates which contact is the designated territory owner.<br>  - **Connections**. The tab displays accounts, leads, and opportunities linked to the territory. This provides a consolidated view of key customer-related objects without switching pages. The tab supports filtering of accounts by industry, tier, type, and country. |
| Customer 360 | Accounts section | Changed | Added a new "Assign territory" bulk action to the **Accounts** section as part of the newly released **Territory management** app. It lets you assign accounts without a territory and reassign accounts from multiple territories to a single destination territory through a unified multi-step flow. The action availability is managed by the "Can assign territory" (`CanAssignTerritory` code) system operation. Out of the box, only users that have the "System administrators" role can execute the action. The bulk action appears in the UI only after the **Territory management** app is installed. This change provides a unified, controlled flow for territory assignment and reassignment. It reduces manual effort, improves data accuracy, and gives users clear visibility into reassignment paths. Consolidating assignment and reassignment into a single flow simplifies decision-making and keeps territory structures consistent. Permission-based access ensures that only authorized users can perform these high-impact updates, strengthening data governance and preventing unintended organizational changes. |
| Customer 360 | Account page | Changed | Added support for scheduled insight delivery for target accounts. The functionality automates retrieval of external news and insights for owned accounts and delivers updates directly to the **News & insights** tab on the account page. Users can activate the scheduling flow from the Creatio.ai chat panel using a prompt such as "Send me news for my accounts." If scheduling is already active, the platform displays the active delivery frequency and allows the user to continue or cancel. Scheduler is limited to 50 active accounts to prevent overload. After confirmation, the user selects a delivery frequency (weekly or monthly), and the platform schedules recurring insight delivery, stores insights on the tab, and immediately provides an initial batch of 3–5 insights. The delivery process includes audit logging and retry logic in case of failure. Users can cancel the scheduled delivery at any time in the Creatio.ai chat panel. This change transforms manual insight search into an automated workflow, helping sales teams stay informed about important developments for their accounts with minimal effort. The scheduler limit ensures platform stability, and audit logging improves transparency and traceability. |
| Creatio Marketing | Campaign Designer | Changed | Fixed the issue that occurred when saving a campaign that contained an "Add audience" element with a complex folder filter based on related objects, for example, `Account.ParentAccount.Address`. The issue was caused by ambiguous SQL aliases that prevented the campaign from saving and returned a generic validation message "One or more errors occurred." The internal SQL query generation logic was updated to correctly alias columns in complex filters involving related schema attributes, eliminating ambiguity and preventing SQL validation errors during campaign save. This change enhances the stability and usability of the Campaign Designer when using advanced filtering logic for audience selection. |
| Email marketing | Bulk emails section | Changed | Enabled domain verification without requiring a value in the **Default ESP email** field on the **Email settings** page. This change simplifies email infrastructure configuration by allowing domain verification to function without a mandatory default sender. The update provides more flexible management of email sending domains and streamlines setup for email marketers. |
| Email marketing | Bulk emails section | Changed | Enabled multilingual support for the **Preview text** field on the bulk email page. This change allows email designers to define localized pre-header text so recipients see preview content in their preferred language. The update improves personalization, enhances engagement, and ensures a consistent multilingual email experience. |
| Email marketing | Email Designer | Changed | Added the **Table** content block to Email Designer, allowing insertion and configuration of tables directly within bulk email templates. This change expands layout flexibility in the **Email Marketing** app and enables richer, more structured email content without requiring external HTML editing. |
| Lead Generation | Landing pages section | Fixed | Fixed the issue where checkbox values submitted through landing pages were incorrectly processed by webhooks. Previously, values such as "on" and "off" were not recognized as "true" and "false", which could result in incorrect data saving or processing. The platform now interprets these values correctly, ensuring accurate data saving and automation logic. |
| Creatio Service | Object Designer | Changed | Added concise object- and column-level descriptions for database tables frequently used in Creatio Service, including the "Case" (`Case` code), "Service" (`ServiceItem` code), "Service agreement" (`ServicePact` code), and "Chat" (`OmniChat` code) objects, as well as the related lookups. Updated descriptions clarify purpose and usage of core objects and previously ambiguous columns, improving data transparency and supporting AI-driven scenarios. |
| Creatio Service | Case page (Classic UI) | Fixed | Fixed an issue where portal messages in Classic UI could be submitted twice when users clicked **Publish** multiple times during delayed responses. The button now stays inactive until the message is successfully published or an error occurs, preventing duplicate submissions and ensuring correct case history. |
| Case Management | Dashboards | Changed | Added new service dashboards to the new **Dashboards** section. These dashboards are delivered as part of the **Case Management** app and consolidate key service metrics and provide role-specific views into workloads, trends, and performance to support informed decision-making and proactive service management.<br>More details<br>Added the following dashboards:<br>- "Agent command center" is a dashboard that helps service agents track assigned cases, monitor case statuses, and review individual performance metrics.<br>- "Case intelligence" is a dashboard that helps service managers uncover service trends, detect exceptions, and identify opportunities for operational improvement.<br>- "Service command center" is a dashboard that provides service leaders with real-time visibility into overall service effectiveness and organizational performance. |

## Creatio Mobile [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-2-twin-changelog\#title-creatio-mobile "Direct link to Creatio Mobile")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No-code customization | Freedom UI Mobile Designer | Changed | Added the new Freedom UI Mobile Designer that lets you customize mobile pages using elements from the element library or extended element list in source code. The functionality is managed by the `UseMobilePageDesigner` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and enabled. Previously, the feature was under beta testing. |
| No-code customization | Freedom UI Mobile Designer | Changed | Added automatic page title generation for pages in Freedom UI Mobile Designer. This change ensures consistent, meaningful, and maintainable page titles without requiring manual setup.<br>More details<br>- For list pages, the title is now generated automatically based on the name of the section to which the page is bound.<br>- For form pages, the title is derived from the title column of the connected object. |
| No-code customization | Freedom UI Mobile Designer | Fixed | Fixed the issue that occurred during synchronization in Creatio Mobile when users customized mobile pages using Freedom UI Mobile Designer. This change improves synchronization stability and ensures that page extensions are processed correctly in Creatio Mobile. |
| No-code customization | Business Rule Designer | Changed | Enabled the Business Rule Designer to work with mobile pages created in the Freedom UI Mobile Designer. The functionality is managed by the `UseMobileDesignerBusinessRules` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and enabled, i.e., the ![btn_open_business_rules_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_open_business_rules_designer.png) button in the top right is displayed. Previously, the feature was under beta testing. |
| Freedom UI Mobile components | Button component | Changed | Added support for refreshing multiple page data sources for the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter in the setup area of Freedom UI Mobile Designer is set to "Refresh data." Out of the box, the **Data refresh mode** parameter on the setup area is set to "Refresh all" and the button refreshes all page data sources, including data sources added after this action was configured. You can exclude some data sources from refreshing if needed. To do this, fill out the **Which data sources to exclude?** parameter. Since dependent data sources and sources created in runtime are always refreshed, they are not displayed in the exclusion list. You can also change the refreshing mode to refresh only specific data sources. To do this, set the **Data refresh mode** parameter to "Refresh specific data sources" and fill out the **Which data sources to refresh?** parameter. This change affects existing environments. After Creatio is updated, the **Button** component whose **Action** parameter in the setup area is set to "Refresh data" refreshes only the specified data sources to ensure backward compatibility.<br>More details<br>The `LoadDataRequest` class is updated as follows:<br>- Added an optional `refreshDataConfig` property. If the property is omitted, the behavior of refreshing data remains the same as before the enhancement.<br>  <br>- Added a new `RefreshMode` enumeration that refreshes all data sources on the page and lets you exclude specific data sources.<br>  - If `refreshDataConfig.mode` is set to `RefreshMode.RefreshAll` and `refreshDataConfig.excludedDataSourceNames` is omitted, all data sources on the page are refreshed.<br>  - If `refreshDataConfig.mode` is set to `RefreshMode.RefreshAll` and `refreshDataConfig.excludedDataSourceNames` is set, all data sources on the page except the specified data sources are refreshed. If the data source depends on the excluded data source, the dependent data source is not refreshed.<br>  - If `refreshDataConfig.mode` is set to `RefreshMode.RefreshSpecific`, the data sources specified in `refreshDataConfig.targetDataSourceNames` are refreshed. Other data sources on the page are not refreshed.<br>- Added a new `RefreshDataConfig` interface that defines the data refresh mode. |
| Freedom UI Mobile components | Button component | Changed | Applied `"width": "100%"` styling to the host element and its first child element of the **Button** component. This change enables buttons to stretch horizontally inside column-oriented **Flex container** layout elements whose properties are `"direction": "column"` and `"alignItems": "stretch"`, or when placed inside the **Data grid** component, ensuring consistent and predictable layout behavior. |
| Freedom UI Mobile components | Attachments component | Added | Added support for the **Attachments** component in the Creatio Mobile to enable uploading and downloading files on `ViewModel` pages. The component works as an embedded **List** component and supports fullscreen display, for example, in a separate tab. It filters files based on the parent record using the same `ViewModel` logic as the **List** component. Tapping a file opens it in the native file viewer. The list displays the file name as the primary title and supports additional attributes such as upload date, size, and owner, with the option to configure other attributes.<br>More details<br>Additionally, added support for the `masterRecordColumnValue` property in the **Attachments** component to enable filtering attachments by a specific column of the primary record, which is especially useful for non–"Uploaded file" (`SysFile` code) objects. The relation can be defined using the `masterRecordColumnValue` and `recordColumnName` properties. For example, `"masterRecordColumnValue": "$Account"` and `"recordColumnName": "Account"` properties ensure that only files related to the current account are displayed on the account page. For "Uploaded file" (`SysFile` code) objects, the default filtering by `$Id` remains unchanged. |
| Freedom UI Mobile components | Sort component | Changed | Added support for binding the **Sort** component directly to a specified data source. This change ensures that sorting operations are applied accurately even when multiple data sources are present within the same page layout, improving sorting consistency and reducing configuration ambiguity. |
| Freedom UI Mobile layout elements | Flex container element | Changed | Added support for the `"alignItems": "stretch"` property in the **Flex container** layout element when using the `"direction": "column"` configuration. This change ensures that child components expand horizontally to match the container width when placed in a vertically oriented flex layout. |
| Freedom UI Mobile layout elements | Tabs element | Changed | Added support for managing tab visibility through the ![btn_visible.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCodePlatform/set_up_dashboards/btn_visible.png) button in the setup area of the **Tabs** element. When the visibility parameter is set to "Visible," Creatio Mobile displays the tab immediately. Otherwise, the tab is hidden. This change enables adaptive mobile interfaces aligned with business rules or user roles without additional development effort. |
| Freedom UI Mobile layout elements | Tabs element | Fixed | Fixed an issue in Creatio Mobile where components and elements placed after a **Tabs** element on a record page were not displayed due to a rendering pipeline interruption. This change ensures that all page items are rendered correctly in mobile layouts. |
| Freedom UI Mobile components,<br>Freedom UI Mobile layout elements | Components,<br>Elements | Changed | Added a mechanism that detects when a Freedom UI Mobile component is placed inside a parent Freedom UI Mobile layout element with infinite (flexible) height and adapts component behavior dynamically. Components now determine whether the parent layout element has bound or unbound height and switch between inline and scrollable behavior. This change includes support for all flex directions and ensures stable layout behavior without regressions. |
| Data models | Data model attribute | Changed | Implemented automatic generation of the primary value and primary display value attributes. Developers no longer need to add these attributes manually to the page in Freedom UI Mobile Designer. This change simplifies page configuration and reduces the risk of issues when working with object bindings. |
| Administration | Data synchronization | Changed | Improved the metadata synchronization mechanism in Creatio Mobile. Creatio Mobile now synchronizes metadata for all records automatically, removing the need to specify them manually in the mobile app manifest. The functionality is managed by the `MobileFeatures.SyncAllEntitySchemas` additional feature. Out of the box, registered and enabled. |
| Administration | Data synchronization | Fixed | Fixed an issue where the **Settings** page in Creatio Mobile initially displayed synchronization settings from a non-active workspace. The issue occurred consistently on the first opening of the page, while subsequent openings typically showed the correct configuration. This change ensures that the page always loads synchronization settings for the correct workspace on the initial load. |
| Administration | Data synchronization | Changed | Changed the `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols` library to version 8.0.2 to align with .NET 8 compatibility and incorporate improvements from the updated LDAP protocol library. This change enhances integration reliability and supports better security, performance, and maintainability in directory service operations. |
| Administration | Data synchronization | Fixed | Fixed the issue where the metadata cache was not cleared during the first synchronization. This change ensures that configuration changes are applied correctly after the initial synchronization and prevents the use of outdated metadata. |

## Beta testing of new features [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/releases/changelog/8-3-2-twin-changelog\#title-beta-testing-of-new-features "Direct link to Beta testing of new features")

| Category | Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No-code customization | Freedom UI Designer,<br>Freedom UI Mobile Designer | Changed | Added a hierarchical structure view for page elements in the Freedom UI Designer and Freedom UI Mobile Designer. A new **Structure** tab displays page elements as a nested tree using element names or codes. The structure view is synchronized with the canvas and supports search, selection, editing, deletion, copying, and moving elements. Movement is allowed only into valid containers. Non-movable elements enforce layout rules. The tree updates automatically when users select elements on the canvas. The functionality is managed by the `InterfaceDesignerShowStructureTab` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. |
| Fields and inputs | "Date/Time" type field | Changed | Added a new **Show seconds** checkbox to the "Date/Time" type field in Freedom UI Designer. The checkbox becomes available when the **Format** parameter is set to either "Date" or "Date/Time." When selected, "Date/Time" type fields accept and display values in the HH:MM:SS format, allowing users to enter seconds manually. The UI continues to display only hours and minutes, and second-level precision is handled through direct input. When the checkbox is cleared, "Date/Time" type fields continue to show only hours and minutes in the HH:MM format, while stored seconds are preserved and displayed again once the checkbox is re-selected, ensuring no loss of stored precision. The functionality is managed by the `EnableSecondsForDateTime` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. |
| Freedom UI Mobile components | Progress bar component | Added | Added a **Progress bar** component to display DCM case stages in Creatio Mobile apps. The component visualizes the process flow using labeled, color-coded stages, highlights the current stage and status, supports horizontal scrolling for scenarios that have multiple stages, and is fully responsive for mobile use cases, including offline work. The component reflects DCM stage changes dynamically, supports grouped stages and role-based restrictions, handles missing filtering or stage columns gracefully, and adapts to different DCM stages. The functionality is managed by the `UseMobileProgressBarComponent` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. |
| Authentication | OpenID authentication | Changed | Added support for email-based fallback user provisioning for OpenID authentication. The functionality is managed by the `OpenIDEmailBasedUserProvisioning` additional feature. Out of the box, unregistered and disabled. When enabled, the platform attempts to locate a user by email if the `sub` field value is empty or unmatched, allowing automatic association with Creatio user accounts originally created without OpenID linkage. This enhancement simplifies identity-provider migrations and SSO protocol transitions, reduces administrative overhead, and maintains user continuity without requiring manual profile updates. |
