Release date: 03/16/2021

We at Creatio are constantly working to deliver advanced capabilities to accelerate your sales, service, and marketing processes. Here are the **new features** included in Creatio version 7.17.3.

The update guide for on-site applications is available in a separate [article](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2495).

## Low-code Platform [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-50 "Direct link to Low-code Platform")

### BPM tools [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-1 "Direct link to BPM tools")

#### Permissions to run a process [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-2 "Direct link to Permissions to run a process")

- It is now possible to grant permissions to run a particular business process on the process’s Properties page without opening the Process Designer. This streamlines the permission setup flow and helps the system administrator to manage permissions based on process folders. For instance, they can grant permissions to run case-related processes to support team and its managers. These permissions affect only manually-launched business processes and only the users without "Can run business processes" system operation permission.

#### Process files [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-3 "Direct link to Process files")

- The report files generated by business processes can now have custom file name patterns. You can set up the pattern in the **Process file**  element’s new **File name**  parameter. This parameter will appear if the file source in the element settings is set to "Generated report."
New parameter in the Process file element's settings

![New parameter in the Process file element's settings](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_7_17_3/scr_release_notes_process_file_element_settings.png)

- New file source in the **Process file** element: a process parameter.


#### Send emails [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-4 "Direct link to Send emails")

- Improved the localized template selection algorithm in the **Send email**  element. If the **To**  field has contacts with different preferred languages or the preferred language is not specified for some recipients, the message will use the default language.

### Administration [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-5 "Direct link to Administration")

#### Creatio with .NET Core [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-6 "Direct link to Creatio with .NET Core")

#### User management [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-7 "Direct link to User management")

- Improved the automatic user session extension algorithm. There were possible scenarios in the previous version where the session would not get extended automatically.
- Streamlined the flow to unblock users Creatio blocked for entering an incorrect password several times in a row. The system administrator can now unblock users by clicking the  **Unblock**  button on the relevant user’s page.

#### Licensing [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-8 "Direct link to Licensing")

- Starting from version 7.17.4, you will need to request new licenses and specify the Creatio version you are going to use before updating on-site deployed Creatio instance. This will streamline the update flow as the new licenses will support the specified version and earlier.

### Integrations [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-9 "Direct link to Integrations")

#### Web services [​](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/release-notes/7173-release-notes\#title-1966-10 "Direct link to Web services")

- It is now possible to integrate SOAP web services automatically. The integration wizard lets you upload a relevant WSDL or XSD file in a couple of clicks. You can select only the necessary web service methods and their parameters. Creatio will set up the web service integration with the corresponding options. The web service call code will be generated automatically based on the uploaded file.
