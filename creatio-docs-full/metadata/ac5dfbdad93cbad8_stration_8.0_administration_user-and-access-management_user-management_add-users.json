  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nManage Creatio users in the **System users** section. User settings determine what operations users can perform, what data they can see and how they can work with this data.\nnote\nBy default, only system administrators have access to the **System users** section.\nClick ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_system_designer.png) \u2192 **System users** to access the **System users** section.\n## Add a system administrator user\u200b\nBy default, Creatio has a \"**System administrators** \" organizational role whose members have full access to all data in Creatio. This is achieved through access to the following system operations:\n* \"Add any data\" (\"CanInsertEverything\" code)\n* \"Delete any data\" (\"CanDeleteEverything\" code)\n* \"Edit any data\" (\"CanUpdateEverything\" code)\n* \"View any data\" (\"CanSelectEverything\" code)\nLearn more: [Description of system settings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1259).\nTo add a new system administrator user in Creatio:\n1. In the **Contacts** section, **create a contact** for the new user or make sure that the relevant contact already exists. Learn more: Add a new contact.\n2. In the **System users** section, **create a new user** , specifying the contact in the user profile. Learn more: Create a user.\n3. Add the user to the \"System administrators\" role.\nImportant\nAccess to these operations overrides any object permissions a user may have. For example, a user with permission to the \"View any data\" system operation can view all records in objects, even if you try to deny the \"Read\" permission for that user in the object permissions UI.\nThere are several ways to assign a system administrator role to a user:\n* From the user page\n* From the role page\n### Method 1. Assign a system administrator role to a user from the user\u2019s page\u200b\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_system_designer00001.png) \u2192 System Designer \u2192 **System users**.\n2. Open the user page \u2192 the **Roles** tab.\n3. Click ![btn_com_add_tab.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_com_add_tab.png) in the **Organizational roles** detail and specify the \"**System administrators** \" role (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Assigning a system administrator role to a user from the user\u2019s page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Assigning a system administrator role to a user from the user\u2019s page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/gif_section_users_add_sys_admin1.gif)\nAs a result, the user will be added to the \"System administrators\" role and will receive full access to all Creatio data.\n### Method 2. Assign a system administrator role to a user from the role page\u200b\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_system_designer00002.png) \u2192 **Organizational roles**.\n2. In the list of organizational roles represented in the form of a folder tree, select the \"System administrators\" role. The area to the right of the roles tree will show the page of the selected role.\n3. On the **Users** tab:\n1. Click ![btn_com_add_tab00003.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_com_add_tab00003.png) and select **Add existing** to **add an existing user**.

You will need to fill out the new user page.\nFig. 2 Assigning a system administrator role to a user via the Organizational roles section\n![Fig.\u00a02 Assigning a system administrator role to a user via the Organizational roles section](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/gif_section_users_add_sys_admin2.gif)\nAs a result, the user will be added to the \"System administrators\" role and will receive full access to all data in Creatio.\n## Add a regular employee user\u200b\nTo create a new user account for a regular employee:\n1. In the **Contacts** section, **create a contact** for the new user or make sure that the relevant contact already exists. Learn more: Add a new contact.\n2. In the **System users** section, **create a new user** , specifying the contact in the user profile. Learn more: Create a user.\n3. **Assign the user a role** , if applicable. Learn more: [Assign a user role](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2005).\n4. **Distribute licenses** to the user. Learn more: [Issue a license to a user](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2309).\n## Add a new contact\u200b\n1. Go to the **Contacts** section \u2192 **Create contact**.\n2. Fill out the required fields on the contact mini-page and click **Save** (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Adding a new contact\n![Fig.\u00a03 Adding a new contact](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/gif_section_users_add_contact.gif)\nAs a result, a new contact will be added to Creatio, and you will be able to create a user for this contact.\nnote\nYou can also add a new contact directly from the contact lookup page when filling out the **Contact** field on the user page. Click ![btn_com_lookup.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_com_lookup.png) in the **Contact** field, then click **New** in the lookup box that pops up. Fill out the contact page that opens. After you save the contact page, you will return to the new user page, with the **Contact** field populated with the newly-created contact.\n## Create a user\u200b\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer00005.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/btn_system_designer00005.png) \u2192 **System users**.\n2. Click **New** \u2192 **Company employee** (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Select a user type\n![Fig.\u00a04 Select a user type](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/adding_users/scr_section_users_add_user.png)\nnote\nYou can change the type of the user (\"Company employee\" or \"Portal user\") after saving the new user record and reopening the user page.\n3. Fill out the fields on the page that opens:\n1. **Contact** \u2013 select the user\u2019s contact in the **Contacts** section.\n2. **Type** \u2013 Creatio populates the field automatically when you select the user type at step 2. The possible field values are \"Portal user\" or \"Company employee\".\n3. **Active** \u2013 a status checkbox selected automatically for active users. Clear the checkbox to deactivate a user.\n4. **Culture** \u2013 the interface language for the current user. Creatio populates the value automatically, the user can change the interface language in the user\u2019s profile.\nnote\nThe **Culture** field displays active languages. To select other languages, activate them in the **Languages** section of the System designer. Learn more about Creatio cultures: [Manage UI languages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1624).\n5. **Home page** \u2013 select a section page that will open by default when the user logs in to Creatio. If you leave the field empty, the user will be redirected to the Main Menu, and upon subsequent logins \u2013 to the last opened page during the previous session.\n6. **Date and time format** \u2013 specify the format that will be used to display dates for the user. You can leave the field blank, the user will be able to specify the format later in the user profile.\n4. Fill out the fields on the **Authentication** detail:\n1. **Username** \u2013 enter the Creatio user's login. This is a required field.\n2. **Email** \u2013 enter the Creatio user's login email. If you fill out this field, the user will be able to log in with either the username or the email.\n3. **Password** , **Password confirmation** \u2013 enter the password the user will use to log in to Creatio. These are required fields.\n4. **Password expiration date** \u2013 the field is non-editable and displays the date when the password expires. The date is calculated based on the **Default value** field of the \"Password validity term, days\" (\"MaxPasswordAge\" code) system setting. The value is set to \"0\" by default, in which case the password has no expiration date, and the **Password expiration date** field on the user\u2019s page remains blank and locked.\n5. **Reset password** \u2013 select this checkbox if you want to force the user to change their password when logging in for the next time. If the checkbox is selected on the user\u2019s page, Creatio will notify the user that their password has expired and request changing it at the next login attempt.\nnote\nIf you use the LDAP authentication, select the **LDAP authentication** checkbox and specify the username from the LDAP lookup in the **Username** field. The lookup in this field contains the list of LDAP users that have not been synchronized with Creatio yet. Learn more: [Set up LDAP synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=513).\n5.
