  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0Marketing\nOn this page\nUse the **Marketing plans** section in Creatio to create marketing plans for promoting a brand, attracting new leads, schedule a series of activities, such as events, webinars, and bulk emails. You can manage your marketing activities in terms of weeks, months, and quarters.\nIn the **Marketing plans** section, there are two types of records: a \"marketing plan\" and a \"marketing activity.\"\nA **marketing plan** is a schedule of activities that comprises the marketing strategy of a company. The schedule contains several activities with assigned owners, deadlines, and budgets.\n**Marketing activity** is a specific activity within a marketing plan.\nnote\nA list of marketing activities can be found in the **Marketing plans** section and is not to be confused with the **Activity** section records.\nAll marketing plans can be viewed by clicking the ![btn_marketing_plans_plans.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online%20marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_plans.png) button at the top of the section workspace.\nTo view detailed information, open the page by clicking the marketing plan title.\nTo view activities for all marketing plans, click the ![btn_marketing_plans_activities.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online%20marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_activities.png) button.\nTo view and analyze activities within each of the marketing plans, we recommend using standard filters or set up a custom folder in the **Filter** menu.\nnote\nFor example, to display the calendar of activities within a specific marketing plan, set up a standard filter for the **Marketing plan** column.\nBy clicking the ![btn_marketing_plans_list_view.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online%20marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_list_view.png) and ![btn_marketing_plans_calendar_view.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online%20marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_calendar_view.png) buttons at the top right of the workspace section, you can choose whether records are displayed as a **drop-down list** or as **scheduled periods** in the calendar (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Viewing marketing activities as a calendar\n![Fig.\u00a01 Viewing marketing activities as a calendar](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online%20marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/activities_month_view.png)\nIn the **View** button menu, you can choose to display activities by week, by month, or by quarter.
