  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1All Creatio products\nOn this page\nSince Creatio 8.0 Atlas, Creatio adds the required dependencies automatically for elements created or modified using Freedom UI Designer. I. e., you can use the functionality of all app packages when working with Freedom UI pages, sections, objects, business processes, web services, and configuration elements. This makes no-code development easy and comfortable for users.\nA **cyclic dependency** is a dependency that occurs when the same package is dependent on the current package and is part of a index of packages on which the current package depends directly or via a dependency chain. Cyclic dependency chains lead to app runtime errors.\nConsider an app with `A`, `B`, and `C` packages where the `B` package depends on the `A` package, and the `C` package depends on the `B` package. Using an element of the `C` package in the `A` or `B` package the `C` package to be their dependency. Creatio will not execute an operation with such a requirement since it will cause a cyclic chain (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Cyclic chain\n![Fig.\u00a01 Cyclic chain](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/cyclic_sequences/scr_example_cyclic_sequences.png)\nUsing apps that have cyclic dependencies can cause Creatio runtime issues. To avoid this, Creatio checks the app elements used and dependencies configured while saving the app changes. If cyclic dependency chains are detected as part of the check-up, Creatio saves the changes but does not save new package dependencies. You will receive a recommendation to check and fix the dependencies configured. The notification will contain more information about the error as well (Fig. 2):\n* **Source** is a part of the schema that refers to the error-causing element.\n* **Reference** is a name of the element that causes the error.\n* **Package** is a name of the package that contains the element.\nFig. 2 Error message for a cyclic dependency\n![Fig.\u00a02 Error message for a cyclic dependency](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/cyclic_sequences/scr_error_cyclic_sequences.png)\nWe recommend fixing cyclic dependencies before you configure the app further to ensure its operability.\n## Cyclic chain examples\u200b\nThis section covers several example solutions that cause cyclic chain errors.\nExample 1\nIf you use an existing configuration element from the `Custom` package (Fig. 3) in the \"UserApplication\" custom app, this will cause a cyclic chain error. Cause: the `Custom` package depends on every configuration package by default, including the \"UserApplication\" package. However, the \"UserApplication\" package must depend on the `Custom` package to access its elements.\nFig. 3 Package hierarchy\n![Fig.\u00a03 Package hierarchy](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/cyclic_sequences/scr_hierarchy_cyclic_sequences.png)\nExample 2\nYou have created \"Application1\" and \"Application2\" apps. If you use \"Application1\" elements in \"Application2,\" Creatio adds \"Application1\" to \"Application2\" as a dependency automatically. If you use the functionality of the \"Application2\" app in the \"Application1\" app to improve the latter, this will cause a cyclic chain error.\n## Prevent cyclic chains\u200b\nTo avoid cyclic chains, we recommend the following:\n* If you configure an app using elements from another app, mind the app's resulting dependencies. Transfer both apps into a different environment to ensure the app works as intended.\n* Only save the improvements that the app uses to the app package. Make all possible changes in the No-Code Designer of the app. Keep an eye on packages where your changes are saved. If changes are saved to an unintended package, ensure they are moved to the appropriate package in the **Configuration** section.\n## Resolve the cyclic chain issue\u200b\nView examples that resolve the cyclic chain issue in the table below.\nExamples that resolve the cyclic chain issue\nWay to eliminate cyclic chains| Example  \n---|---  \nIf you use the wrong elements by mistake, which caused a cyclic chain, you can delete them or replace them with new elements that do not cause a cyclic chain. After that, save the changes to readd the dependencies.  \nObjects or business processes that use methods and **Script task** element cannot be published before you eliminate the cyclic chain issue.| The **Read data** business process element reads a redundant column or uses it in filtering conditions. To eliminate the cyclic chain, simply delete the column and save the business process.  \nIf the elements that cause a cyclic chain are not critical to the app operation or you made the changes by mistake, simply revert the changes to eliminate all newly introduced cyclic chains.| You replaced the **UsrObject** object both in the \"UserApplication\" app package and the `Custom` package. The **Column** object column created in the `Custom` package has a different **Name** property in the \"UserApplication\" package. Since you made the changes in the dependent package, this caused a cyclic chain. To eliminate it, simply return the property to its original state and save the updated object.  \nIf you cannot edit or delete the elements that caused a cyclic chain, move them:\n* to the package that contains the dependent schemas of the elements\n* to the package from which the package that contains the schemas inherits.\nLearn more in a different section: [Move the functionality between packages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2419&anchor=title-2534-8).| A cyclic chain was made when you used the **UsrLookup** lookup of the `Custom` package in the \"UserApplication\" app. The lookup is the data source for the **UsrEntity** object\u2019s lookup column. To fix the error, move the **UsrLookup** lookup to the \"UserApplication\" app package.  \nImportant\nDo not replace a single object in a single package more than once. If the cyclic chain is caused by two replacements of a single object in two different packages, move the schema that causes the cyclic chain to a third package. The package where you configure the app must inherit from the package to which you moved the schema.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Manage apps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2444)\n[Packages basics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15121)",
