  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nCreatio contacts are the contact persons of the customers and partners, individual clients, and other business contacts.\nUse the **Contacts** section to work with contacts. Use this section to group the contacts by various parameters, analyze the history of interactions with customers, and view the resulting statistics.\nContact personal data are stored in the contact\u2019s profile, on the **Communication channels** and **Addresses** details at the **Contact info** tab, and on the **Job experience** detail at the **current employment** tab. In the database, they correspond to the following tables: \"Contact,\" \"ContactCommunication,\" \"ContactAddress,\" and \"ContactCareer.\"\nIn Creatio, a contact can be:\n* added manually\n* [imported](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1252) from Excel\n* imported from the [landing page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1083)\n* saved manually or automatically during [lead qualification](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1216) (available in Sales Creatio and Marketing Creatio)\n* received through [synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=1733) with social networks\n* received through [Google synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/setup_and_administration/base_integrations)\n* created with incoming mail processing\n* created with [Single Sign-On](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=1649) authentication.\nImportant\nTo synchronize with external resources, you need to perform the initial setup. Social network integration, Google synchronization, and Single Sign-On technology are described in the \"[Base integrations](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/setup_and_administration/base_integrations)\" section.\n## Create a contact manually\u200b\n1. Open the **Contacts** section\n2. Click the **New Contact** button.\n3. In the opened window, fill out the contact profile:\nFull name| First and last names of the contact. The field is required.  \n---|---  \nType| Type of contact, for example, \"Customer\" or \"Contact person.\"  \nAccount| The company whose employee the contact is.  \nFull job title| Contact's current position.  \nDepartment| The department of the company where the contact works.  \nMobile phone| Contact's mobile phone number. The value is synchronized with the **Communication options** detail of the **General information** tab.  \nEmail| The email address of the contact. The value is synchronized with the **Communication options** detail of the **General information** tab.  \n4. Click **Save**.\n5. On the page that opens, add a photo of the contact to display on the contact page, the section list, and the feed. To add a photo, click ![btn_add_userpic.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/accounts_contacts/BPMonlineHelp/accounts_and_contacts_add_contact/btn_add_userpic.png) and upload the photo using the standard file selection window. We recommend uploading a square image (aspect ratio: 1:1). Click on the ![btn_delete_userpic.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/accounts_contacts/BPMonlineHelp/accounts_and_contacts_add_contact/btn_delete_userpic.png) button to remove the photo. If you mouse over the photo area, the buttons will become visible.\n6. On the **General information** tab, populate the contact data:\nType| Type: customer, supplier, contact person, or employee. If you populate this field on the previous step, the data will automatically display on the **General information** tab.  \n---|---  \nOwner| Name of the responsible employee.  \nTitle| Honorific for the contact, for example, \"Mr\" or \"Mrs.\"  \nGender| Gender of the contact.  \nSalutation| The preferred way to address the contact.  \nPreferred language| The language to use by default for automated communications with the contact. Affects the language of email notifications. If no preferred language is set for a contact, the notifications will be sent in English (the default language). The drop-down list of this field contains only languages whose status is set to \"Active\" in the **Customer languages** lookup.  \nAge| Contact age. The field is populated automatically and is grayed out if automatic calculation of contact age is enabled. Creatio calculates a contact\u2019s age based on the value in the **Birthdate** field. If the **Birthdate** field is empty, the value in the **Age** field will be \"0.\" If you disable the automatic calculation of contact age, the **Age** field will become editable. More information about age calculation is available in the \"[Contact age calculation](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=2046)\" article.  \n7. Specify the addresses and communication options of the contact. Learn more in the \"[Manage contact communication options](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=1309)\" article.\n8. Add dates important for the contact on the **Noteworthy events** detail. The detail fields are displayed when you select the corresponding commands in the ![btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/accounts_contacts/BPMonlineHelp/accounts_and_contacts_add_contact/btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png) menu.\nType| Type of the noteworthy event, such as \"Birthday\" or \"Company day.\" Defined when a record is added. You can change it afterward.  \n---|---  \nDate| Date of the noteworthy event.  \nnote\nNoteworthy events of the \"Birthday\" type are linked to the **Birthdate** field of the contact. If you populate the **Birthdate** field, a \"Birthday\" noteworthy event will be automatically created for the contact. Likewise, if you add a noteworthy event of the \"Birthday\" type, the **Birthdate** field will be populated accordingly. The same applies whenever the existing data is modified.\n9. Specify the connections between the selected contact and other contacts and accounts using the **Connected to** detail. Learn more in the \"[Create connections between companies and accounts](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=1315)\" article.\n10. Navigate to the **Current employment** tab and populate contact career data. Learn more in the \"[Manage contact career](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=2161)\" article.\n11. Go to the **Communication channels** tabs to restrict the usage of the communication options. Specify the communication options no to use for communicating with the contact. The **Do not use email** , **Do not use phone** , **Do not use SMS** , **Do not use mail** checkboxes signify which communication options should not be used to contact the person. These fields are non-editable. The values are filled in on the **Communication options** detail of the **General information** tab.\n12. Click **Save**.\nAs a result, a new contact record will be added to Creatio. Update the contact information at any moment, for example, via [data enrichment](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=7&id=1733).\nWhen you save a record, additional actions are available:\n* The contact age is calculated based on the specified birth date. The contact\u2019s age is calculated based on the value in the **Birthdate** field.\n* Duplicates search when saving a record. When you save a contact, a [duplicates search](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=administration&ver=7&id=1591) page might open. It means that this record might be already registered in the system. You can edit the new record or indicate that the records found are not duplicates of the newly saved record.\n## Add a new contact from an email\u200b\nIf an email is received from a contact that has not been registered in the system, the sender's data will be displayed as \"unrecognized\" in the emails. In this case, you can create a new contact record directly from the incoming email. To do this:\n1. Open the email tab in the communication panel.\n2. Select the author of the email for which you want to create a contact.\n3. Click ![btn_contact_data_enrichment.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/accounts_contacts/BPMonlineHelp/accounts_and_contacts_add_contact/btn_contact_data_enrichment.png).\n4. Select the **Create \"contact name\"** from the data enrichment menu ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_18791_103)).\nFig. 1 \u2013 Creating a new contact from the email conversation\n![Fig. 1 \u2013 Creating a new contact from the email conversation](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/scr_email_create_contact.png)\n5. Select the contact data that you want to add in the opened window.\n6. Save the changes.\nAs a result, a new contact will be added to the system. The **History** tab of the new contact page features all emails where the contact is either the sender or recipient over the last seven days. The email will be automatically linked to the new contact.\n## Create a contact from a case\u200b\nService Creatio products enable you to create a new contact from a case page if the case was created based on an email from unknown contact. Adding a new contact that way is similar to adding a contact from an email on the communication panel ([Fig. 2](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_67707_149)). Creating a new contact only requires the name and the email address of the case contact, specified in the \"From\" field in the email (e.g., John Best, `<john.best@gmail.com>`).\nFig. 2 \u2013 Creating a contact from an email on the case page\n![Fig. 2 \u2013 Creating a contact from an email on the case page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/scr_case_create_contact.png)\nThe email used to create a contact will be displayed on the **Email** detail on the contact\u2019s page. Creatio will prompt you to select the contact as the main contact in the case.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Enrich contact data](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1737)\n[Manage job experience](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2161)\n[Manage communication options and addresses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1309)\n[Calculate contact age](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2046)",
