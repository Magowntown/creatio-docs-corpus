  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\n\"Data\" type schema is an entity that lets you bind data to a package. Bind data to ensure the developed functionality is transferred between environments.\nThe items of the **Add** drop-down list in the toolbar of the **Configuration** section workspace represent the data schema you can add in Creatio IDE.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Data/8.0/scr_AddList.png)\nThe \"Data\" type in the **Type** drop-down list in the toolbar of the **Configuration** section workspace represents the \"Data\" type schema.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Data/8.0/scr_TypeList.png)\nWhen you create an app using **Application Hub** , Creatio binds data required for app transferring to the package automatically. **Bind data to an app package manually** if you need to transfer the developed functionality together with specific app data between Creatio instances. For example, demo section records.\nUse manual data binding for the following elements:\n* lookup contents\n* section demo records\n* system settings\n* dashboards\n* Word reports\nImportant\nThe order of data binding depends on the object relationship. If one of the objects depends on the other, bind an object that does not depend on the new objects first.\nTo **implement manual data binding** :\n1. **Select the tool to bind data**.\nBind data manually using one of the following tools:\n* **Configuration** section. To open it, follow the instructions: [Open the **Configuration** section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.3&id=15101&anchor=title-2093-2).\n* **Advanced settings** tab in No-Code Designer. To open it, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 **Application management** \u2192 **Application Hub** \u2192 select the app \u2192 **Advanced settings**.\n2. **Select a user-made package** to add the schema.\n3. **Add a Data schema type**. To do this, click **Add** \u2192 **Data** in the section list toolbar.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Data/8.0/scr_AddList.png)\nThe number of required \"Data\" type schemas depends on the element whose data you are binding to the package. i.e., create a single \"Data\" type schema based on a single object.\n4. **Define the element to bind**.\nElement to bind| Object to bind| Description  \n---|---|---  \nLookup contents| Select a lookup object| Binding data of the custom object based on which the lookup was built.  \nSection demo records| Select a section object| Binding data of the custom object based on which the section was built.  \nSystem settings| SysSettings| `SysSettings` database table stores codes of Creatio system settings.  \nSysSettingsValue| `SysSettingsValue` database table stores values of Creatio system settings.  \nDashboards (Classic UI)| SysDashboard| `SysDashboard` database table stores the connections of dashboards to Creatio sections.  \nAccess rights to configuration schemas| SysSchemaAdminUnitRight| `SysSchemaAdminUnitRight` database table stores access rights to Creatio schemas.  \nWord reports| SysModuleReport| `SysModuleReport` database table stores configured printables.  \nSysModuleReportTable| `SysModuleReportTable` database table stores tabular parts of Word reports.  \n5. **Fill out the schema properties**.\nProperty| Property description  \n---|---  \nCode*| The schema name. The property is populated automatically and becomes editable only after you select an object in the **Object** property.  \nObject*| The object whose data to bind to the package. Select the object based on the element to bind.  \nInstallation type*| Way to add data to Creatio when installing the package. The **Installation type** property supports the following values listed in the table below.| Way| Description  \n---|---  \nInstallation| Data is added during the first installation of the package and is updated with the package updates. New records are always added. Existing records are updated only if the **Forced update** checkbox is selected on the **Columns setting** tab. This is the default and most flexible type.  \nInitial package installation| Data is added only during the first installation of the package. Data is not updated or added during subsequent package updates.  \nUpdate existing| Deprecated type. We recommend using the Installation type instead because this type has similar behavior.  \nInitial data installation| Data binding is installed during the first package installation or subsequent updates only if the same binding does not already exist. Use this type to avoid unintended overwrites.  \nPackage| The user-made package where you create the schema. The property is populated automatically and non-editable.  \n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Data/8.0/scr_data_properties.png)\n6. **Select data to bind** to the package.\n1. Open the **Columns setting** tab.\n2. Select the needed checkbox or checkboxes that contain object data.\n3. Open the **Bound data** tab.\n4. Click **Add**. This opens the **Select: ObjectName** window.\n5. Select the checkbox or checkboxes that contain needed records.\n6. Click **Select**.\n7. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , the needed records will be bound to the app package. Since the functionality of data binding is based on the app package hierarchy, after data is bound, Creatio adds the packages that contain the objects used in the binding to the current package as dependencies automatically.\nWhen you install the app to other Creatio instances, bound data will be transferred together with the developed functionality.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio IDE overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.3&id=15101)",
