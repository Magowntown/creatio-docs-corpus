  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nYou can set up several [record pages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=administration&ver=7&id=1765) for a section, e.g., for different types of section records.\nnote\nSince Creatio 8.3.1, Section and Detail Wizards for Classic UI are no longer available for creating new sections and details. These tools will be deprecated in future releases. We recommend using the modern Freedom UI tools that provide a more flexible and future-ready experience. Learn more: [Overview of Freedom UI Designer and its elements](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376&ver=8.0).\n## Add multiple edit pages to a section\u200b\n1. Open a section, e.g., **Requests**.\n2. In the **Section pages** area, click ![btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png) \u2192 **Add page**.\nnote\nThe **Section pages** area view changes once you save the newly created section in the Section Wizard: the **Set up page** button disappears, the **Edit page** and **Add page** buttons appear instead (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 The Section pages area buttons after saving the new section\n![Fig.\u00a01 The Section pages area buttons after saving the new section](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/chapter_section_wizard_section_pages_area_change.png)\nImportant\nTo add multiple section pages, you need to configure the section main page by clicking **Edit page** first.\n3. Populate the fields in the opened window (Fig. 2):\nFig. 2 Adding a new edit page\n![Fig.\u00a02 Adding a new edit page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/chapter_section_wizard_adding_multiple_pages_setup.png)\n4. **Which field will determine the page layout?** \u2013 select the field, whose values will determine, which page to use for each record. For example, in the **Requests** section, you can set up different edit pages for different request categories: online requests and offline requests.\nnote\nThe corresponding lookup column must be added to the section page, otherwise, it will not be available for selection in the drop-down list of the **Which field will determine the page layout?** field.\n5. **Select the value of the \"...\" field for which the new page will be used** \u2013 the value of the lookup field selected at the previous step. You can specify which page to use for each value in the lookup.\nnote\nFor new sections, populate the corresponding lookup with values in advance, You can also enter a new value directly in the **Select the value of the \"...\" field for which the new page will be used** field and Creatio will offer to add this lookup value. Read more >>>\n6. **Page name** \u2013 the name of the new section page. The field is populated with a default value that looks as follows: \"Edit page: \"Section name\" (Name of the corresponding lookup value).\" For example, \"Edit page: \"Requests\" (Online).\" You can rename the page using any custom name to make it clearer for other users, e.g., \"Online requests\" (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Adding a new edit page\n![Fig.\u00a03 Adding a new edit page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/chapter_section_wizard_adding_multiple_pages_setup00001.png)\n7. Click **Continue**.\n8. On the Content Designer page that opens, configure the added page.\nnote\nYou can set up additional section pages similarly to setting up the first section page.\nMultiple pages of the same section can differ from each other: you can apply separate business rules for the page fields and link different section cases to each section page, as well as add different field groups and details that are only relevant for this particular request category.\n## Disable section page\u200b\n1. Delete the value in the **Values of the \"...\" lookup** column in the **Section pages** area.\n2. After you delete the data, the field will automatically set to \"Not used.\" The page will be saved, but will not open for users (Fig. 4).\n3. Click **Save** to save the changes in the section.\nFig. 4 The section edit page is not used anymore\n![Fig.\u00a04 The section edit page is not used anymore](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/scr_chapter_section_wizard_pages_in_section.png)\n## Delete section page\u200b\nYou can remove a page from the list of section pages completely:\n1. In the **Section pages** block of the Section Wizard, click ![btn_com_roles_actions_menu.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/btn_com_roles_actions_menu.png) next to the name of the section page you want to delete.\n2. Select **Remove** from the drop-down menu (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Deleting a section page from the section\n![Fig.\u00a05 Deleting a section page from the section](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/chapter_section_wizard_remove_section_page.gif)\n## Change the column that determines the page view\u200b\n1. In the **Section pages** area, click ![btn_com_folder_filter.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/btn_com_folder_filter.png).\n2. In the opened window, select the new lookup field, e.g., \"Type\" instead of \"Category.\"\nnote\nAfter you change the column, the **Values of the \"...\" lookup** field value will be set to \"Not used\" for all edit pages configured earlier.\n3. Specify the selected lookup values that will use the configured edit pages.\n4. Rename the pages accordingly if needed ([Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Changing the column that determines the page type\n![Fig.\u00a06 Changing the column that determines the page type](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_record_pages/chapter_section_wizard_change_section_page_column.gif)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Customize pages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1398)\n[Add dashboards as page widgets](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=2034)\n[Add mini pages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1906)\n[Page Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=2028)\n[Set up page fields](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1399)\n[Set up page tabs](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1400)\n[Set up page field groups](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1401)",
