  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nInformation about a doctor\u2019s potential significance in terms of pharmacy product promotion is critical for choosing a proper communication strategy with the doctors. In Creatio, this information is available on the doctor\u2019s contact page, in the **Potential** , **Loyalty** and **Category** fields.\nThe **Potential** field contains doctor\u2019s estimated potential, which is an indicator of doctor\u2019s capability to promote pharmacy products. The doctor\u2019s potential is based on the number of patients with specific diagnoses (\"nosology\" or \"ICDs\") that a medical rep recorded during last visit to that doctor. The number of patients is compared with the values in the **Doctor\u2019s potential setup** lookup.\nThe **Loyalty** field contains a general estimation of doctor\u2019s loyalty towards your brand. Loyalty is an indicator of how actively the doctor promotes your products. By default, the loyalty can range from \"1\" (highest) to \"3\" (lowest). The loyalty value is calculated based on the actual prescriptions of your products by the doctor. The number of prescriptions is compared to the values in the **Doctor\u2019s loyalty setup** lookup.\nThe values in the **Potential** and **Loyalty** fields are calculated automatically during doctor categorization.\nThe regional manager analyzes the \"potential\" and \"loyalty\" indicators and assigns doctor\u2019s category. Information about previously assigned categories is automatically saved on the **Categorization history** detail on the contact\u2019s page.\n## Set up calculation of a doctor\u2019s potential and loyalty indicators\u200b\nA doctor\u2019s **potential** indicator depends on the number of patients with various diagnoses who visited the doctor. To set up calculation of the doctor\u2019s potential:\n1. Open system designer. For example, click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_1.png) button.\n2. Go to the **Lookups** section and open the **Doctor\u2019s potential setup** lookup.\n3. Add new lookup records and specify the values of doctor\u2019s potential in the desired format. By default, there are three levels of potential (from highest to lowest): \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\".\n4. Select the doctor specialty, for which the potential value is relevant.\nnote\nSet up separate rules of calculating potential for different doctor specialties.\n5. Assign the value range for the number of patients that visit a doctor of the selected specialty between the measurements (usually taken by a medical rep during visits).\nnote\nTo let medical reps enter data for calculation of potential, set up a connection between the doctor specialties and diagnoses (nosology) of the patients that visit each type of doctor. To do this, edit the records in the **Nosology** lookup.\nThe doctor\u2019s **loyalty** indicator depends on the number of prescriptions for the promoted products the doctor makes between the medical rep\u2019s visits. To set up calculation of the doctor\u2019s loyalty:\n1. Open system designer. For example, click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_1.png) button.\n2. Go to the **Lookups** section and open the **Doctor\u2019s loyalty setup** lookup.\n3. Add new lookup records and specify the values of doctor\u2019s loyalty in the desired format. By default, the loyalty can range from \"1\" (highest) to \"3\" (lowest).\n4. Select the doctor specialty, for which the potential value is relevant.\nnote\nSet up separate rules for calculating loyalty for different doctor specialties.\n5. Assign the value range for the number of prescriptions that a doctor of the selected specialty issues between measurements (usually taken by a medical rep during visits).\nnote\nTo let pharmaceutical reps enter data for calculation of doctor\u2019s loyalty, enter the list of the promoted products in Creatio. You can do this by adding the products to the **Promoted products** detail on the **Products** tab of the doctor\u2019s contact page, or by adding doctors to the **Contacts** detail of the product page.\n## Perform doctor categorization\u200b\nDoctor\u2019s category is assigned by a regional manager and is based on analysis of the doctor\u2019s potential and loyalty indicators. The doctor\u2019s potential and loyalty are calculated based on the information about the number of doctor\u2019s patients and the number of prescriptions of the promoted products issued by the doctor. The information is gathered by medial reps during visits. Creatio automatically assigns the doctor\u2019s potential value if the number of patients is within the range specified for this value in the **Doctor\u2019s potential setup** lookup.\nTo perform doctor categorization:\n1. Select one or more doctor records in the **Contacts** section.\nnote\nYou can also run the categorization action from the contact page, if a contact with the \"Doctor\" type is opened.\n2. Click the **Actions** button and select **Categorize**.\nAs a result, doctor\u2019s potential and loyalty indicators will be calculated. The categorization will run on the background, and you will be notified when it completes.\n3. Select doctor\u2019s category based on the calculated potential and loyalty indicators. Information about previously assigned categories is automatically saved on the **Categorization history detail** on the contact\u2019s page.\nnote\nYou can set up the list of categories in the **Contact category** lookup.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Install Pharma Creatio](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1715)\n[Set up rules and actions of a med rep visit](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2478)\n[Schedule med rep visits](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2479)\n[Conduct med rep visits](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2480)",
