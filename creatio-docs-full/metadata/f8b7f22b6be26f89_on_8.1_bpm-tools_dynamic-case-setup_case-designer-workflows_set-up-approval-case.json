  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nThis chapter covers a step-by-step procedure of setting up a typical approval case: a leave request in the **Documents** section.\n1. Each record with the \"Approval\" type is submitted for approval automatically, right after a new record is saved.\n2. First, an HR employee must approve the request.\n3. Once approved by the HR, the request is submitted for approval by the corresponding department manager.\n4. Approvers will receive email notifications that a new record awaits their approval. The employees who submit requests for approval will receive email notifications about approval results.\n5. If the approval has been denied by HR, the case transitions to the **Preparation** stage, at which the employee must revise the request. If the approval has been denied by the department manager, the case transitions to the **Canceled** stage.\n6. If the request is approved by the department manager, the case transitions to the **Completed** stage.\n7. The **Completed** and **Canceled** stages are final.\nSet up the approval case as shown in Fig. 1.\nImportant\nPlease note that the example below refers to a custom case. Not all fields and values used are available in the base Creatio configuration. You can set up additional section fields in the [Section wizard](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=studio&ver=7&id=1245).\nBefore creating and configuring an approval business process, make sure that the **Enable approval in section** checkbox is selected for that section in the section wizard.

Click Click **View** \u2192 **Set up section cases** in the **Documents** section. The Case Designer will open (Fig. 2).\n2. In the case list, select \"Status\" in the **Which column to build the stages by?** field. As a result, the case stages will be defined by the document status.\n3. Select \"Type\" in the **Which column determines which case to use with a record?** field. As a result, the case will apply only to documents of a specific type (i.e., \"Request\").\nFig. 2 Case list of the Documents section\n![Fig. 2 Case list of the Documents section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/scr_chapter_case_designer_documents_section_cases_list.png)\n4. Click the **New case** button to open the Case Designer. Here you will need to set up:\n* Case parameters.\n* Case sequence.\n* Activities on each case stage.\n## Set up case parameters.\u200b\nThe case parameters are set up in the case setup area (Fig. 3).\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_system_designer.png) to open case properties.\n2. Specify the case title (i.e., \"Request processing\").\n3. Optionally, populate the **Description** field with additional information for anyone who may edit this case.\n4. In the **Use this case with records where:** area, click ![btn_case_designer_case_properties_initial_case_condition_choice.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_case_designer_case_properties_initial_case_condition_choice.png) and select \"Request.\" As a result, the case will apply to all documents of the \"Request\" type.\nImportant\nPlease note that the example below refers to a custom case. Not all fields and values used are available in the base Creatio configuration. You can add document types to the **Document types** lookup. Learn more about working with lookups in the \"[Manage lookup values](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=271)\" article.\n5. The **Section** , **Stage column** , **Code** , **Package** , **Active,** and **Actual version** fields will be populated automatically. \nFig. 3 Case setup area\n![Fig. 3 Case setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_case_properties.png)\n## Set up case stages\u200b\nUse the stages panel to set up the case workflow. The leave request approval case will have 5 stages that correspond to the values in the **Status** field in the **Documents** section. Use the ![btn_case_designer_add_case.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_case_designer_add_case.png) button to add case stages: **Draft** , **Approval** , **Completed** , **Canceled** , and **Archive**. Set up stage properties and steps to complete at each stage. We will use the first stage as an example.\n1. Click the first stage to open its setup area (Fig. 4).\n2. Enter the name of the stage.\n3. Select the corresponding document stage in the **Stage value in the lookup** ![btn_case_designer_choose_from_lookup.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_case_designer_choose_from_lookup.png) field. You can add document stages directly from the Case Designer by typing in the new stage name. Make sure to save the case each time you add a new lookup value this way.\n4. All other case stages will be automatically added to the **Possible next stages** area. Remove all stages from the list, except for the **Approval** and **Canceled** stages.\n5. All other case stages will be automatically added to the **Possible previous stages** area. Remove all stages, except for **Approval** from the list. If the approval is denied, the case will transition back to the **Draft** stage.\n6. In the **Automatic transition to the next case stage** field, select \"If required steps are completed.\"\n7. In the **Additional settings** area, select a color for this stage.\n8. Leave the **Group with another stage** checkbox cleared. Grouped stages will display as one for the case user. Clicking a grouped stage will open a menu with all stages in the group. Note that this checkbox must be selected for the **Canceled** stage, which must be grouped with the **Completed** stage.\nFig. 4 The Draft stage parameters\n![Fig. 4 The Draft stage parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_preparation_stage_properties.png)\nSet up other stage properties in a similar way: \"Approval\" (Fig. 5), \"Completed\" (Fig. 6), \"Canceled\" (Fig. 7), and \"Archive\" (Fig. 8).\nFig. 5 The Approval stage parameters\n![Fig. 5 The Approval stage parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_approving_stage_properties.png)\nFig. 6 The Completed stage parameters\n![Fig. 6 The Completed stage parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_completed_stage_properties.png)\nnote\nThe **Completed** and **Canceled** stages are mutually exclusive and are therefore grouped. The grouping is configured in the properties of the **Canceled** stage. In the setup area of the **Completed** stage, a ![btn_com_information.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_com_information.png) icon is displayed next to the **Group with another stage** checkbox. If you hover the cursor over the icon, a tooltip will appear, indicating that the stage is already grouped.\nFig. 7 The Canceled stage parameters\n![Fig. 7 The Canceled stage parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_completed_stage_properties.png)\nFig. 8 The Archive stage parameters\n![Fig. 8 The Archive stage parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_archived_stage_properties.png)\n## Set up case stage steps\u200b\nSet up the steps of the **Draft** stage.

As a result, whoever is specified as the manager of the employee submitting a leave request, will have to approve it.\nImportant\nPlease note that not all mentioned objects, fields, and values may be available by default in your Creatio configuration. You can set up additional section fields in the [Section wizard](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=studio&ver=7&id=1245).\n5. In the **Change stage after element is completed** area, set up the following stage transitions:\n1. **If result** \u2013 \"Positive;\" **Set stage to** \u2013 \"Completed.\" As a result, if the request is denied by the employee\u2019s manager, the case transitions to the **Canceled** stage.\n2. Click ![btn_button_connections.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_button_connections.png) and add another condition: **If result** \u2013 \"Positive;\" **Set stage to** \u2013 \"Completed.\" As a result, if the request is approved by the employee\u2019s manager, the case transitions to the **Completed** stage.\nThe remaining properties of the \"Manager\u2019s approval\" case element match those of the \"HR approval\" element. As a result, the settings for the case element will look like this (Fig. 12):\nFig. 12 Manager\u2019s approval case element setup area\n![Fig. 12 Manager\u2019s approval case element setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_approving_stage_actions_2.png)\nAt the **Completed** case stage, set up a timer before the document status is changed to \"Archive.\"\n1. Add a new **Subprocess** case element on the Case Designer working area on the **Completed** stage. Enter the name as \"Term of the application relevance\" (Fig. 13).\n2. In the **Which process to run?** field, click and select the application activation business process. If the business process is disabled in the list, click the ![btn_button_connections00007.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_button_connections00007.png) button to add it.\nA Diagram of the business process of transfer application to the archive is provided in Fig. 14.\nThe **Simple start event** and **Wait for timer** process elements \u2013 the process will start after 15 seconds after transitioning the case to the **Completed** stage.\nThe **Modify data** element will change the status of the completed to \"Archive.\"\nFig. 13 Business process diagram\n![Fig. 13 Business process diagram](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_subprocess_stage_bp_scheme.png)\nTo transfer the application by which the case is running, you should set up the transfer of the main record parameter from the case to the process. In our case, the main record is a document and the parameter which getting is to be configured is the document ID. Perform configuration in the Process Designer if the pass of the parameter is not set up. To do this:\n1. Open the designer of the process of transfer the application to the archive by clicking the ![btn_chapter_designer_user_task_designer_task.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_chapter_designer_user_task_designer_task.png) button at the **Which process to run** field.\n2. Double click on the designer workspace to display the edit page of the process parameters.\n3. Click the **Add parameter** button on the **Parameters** tab.\n4. Select the \"Lookup\" in the list of the parameter types and specify the \"Document\" value in the **Lookup** field.\n5. Save the changes.\n3. Return to the Case Designer to the configuration of the \"The term of the application relevance\" element properties. After you specify the process in the **Which process to run** field the parameter described above will be displayed in the **Process parameters** area.\n4. The \"At the start of the stage\" value will be displayed by default in the **When is the step performed?** field.\n5. The \"Optional step\" will be displayed in the **Step type** field. You can make it required, if necessary.\nFig. 14 The term of the application relevance element properties\n![Fig. 14 The term of the application relevance element properties](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_subprocess_stage_actions.png)\n6. Save all changes made in the Case Designer.\n## Configuration results\u200b\nAs a result, all documents of the \"Request\" type will be processed according to the \"Leave of absence approval\" case (Fig. 15). As soon as an employee who created a request clicks the **Approval** stage, the document is submitted for approval to HR. If HR denies the approval, the document status is set back to \"Draft.\" If HR approves the document, it is submitted for the employee's manager's approval. If the manager denies the approval, the document status is set to \"Canceled.\" If the manager approves the request, the document status is set to \"Completed.\"\nFig. 15 Case for leave request approval\n![Fig. 15 Case for leave request approval](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/chapter_case_designer_application_approving_case_illustration.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Execute a case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7124)",
