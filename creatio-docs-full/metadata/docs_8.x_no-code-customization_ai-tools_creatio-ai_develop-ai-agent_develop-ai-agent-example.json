  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nThis article explains how to create a new AI Agent in Creatio step by step.\nExample\nCreate an agent that manages product catalog data.\n## Step 1. Fill out the main agent information\u200b\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/develop_ai_agent/btn_system_designer.png) to **Open the System Designer**.\n2. **Go to** the **System setup** block \u2192 **Creatio.ai agents**.\n3. **Click** **New**. This opens a page.\n4. **Fill out** the main agent information.\nField| Field value  \n---|---  \nName| Human-readable name for your agent. We recommend using short and clear names that reflect the main goal of the agent. For example, \"Product Catalog Agent.\"  \nCode| Technical code used by Creatio and the LLM (large language model). Must start with the \"Usr\" prefix, for example, \"UsrCatalogAgent.\"  \nDescription| Detailed plain text description of what the agent does, when to use it, and how it behaves. The LLM uses this description to invoke the agent correctly, so make sure it is complete and precise. For example, \"Manage the product catalog: add descriptions, update information, analyze sales data by products, and ensure relevance.\"  \nStatus| Whether the agent is active. Available values:\n* **Active** : the agent is active and available to all users.\n* **In development** : the agent is in development and available only to users that have the `CanDevelopAISkills` operation permission. The permission must be added to Creatio manually.\n* **Deactivated** : the agent is disabled and not used by Creatio.  \nModel| Whether to use a specific large language model (LLM). Learn more: [Creatio.ai models](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2528#title-2528-6). Leave the field empty to use GPT-4.1.  \nRole| Role of the agent in Creatio. Also mention any knowledge the agent has in a particular area. For example, \"Act as skilled AI Agent specialized in product management. Have a high level of understanding the catalog structure, business rules, and sales logic.\"  \nAgent instructions| Key interaction rules, response style (formal, informal), and core principles of the agent. If the agent follows a specific flow or logic, describe it here. For example,\"Your responsibilities include:\n* Creating and updating product descriptions Trigger this task when a user adds a new product or requests changes to an existing product. Ensure the description is accurate, relevant, and reflects updated functionality or positioning. Always write in a clear, engaging style.\n* Deactivating products Offer to deactivate a product if it is discontinued, permanently out of stock, outdated, or consistently underperforming with no improvement forecast. Confirm the user\u2019s intention before proceeding.\n* Analyzing product sales When asked, retrieve and analyze sales data for specific products over a given timeframe. Summarize trends and suggest actionable insights, for example, promote bestsellers, revise pricing on low-performers.\n* Structuring product data Assist in categorizing, tagging, and organizing product attributes to improve searchability and reporting accuracy. Identify and flag missing or inconsistent fields.\nMaintain a consistent and structured tone throughout your outputs. Ask clarifying questions when needed and never assume intent without user confirmation.\"  \nLimitations and restrictions| Define what the agent must not do, which behaviors to avoid, and whether it has any constraints on actions or topics. For example, \"Always use polite, helpful, and professional language. All product descriptions and content must be tailored to a tech-savvy audience aged 25\u201345, interested in innovation and modern digital experiences. Follow the brand\u2019s tone of voice: friendly, knowledgeable, concise.\"  \n5. **Click** **Save**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will add a new AI agent. Process to step 2.\n## Step 2. Add AI Skills to the agent\u200b\nSpecify which skills the agent can use in the **AI Skills** expanded list. You can create a new AI Skill directly from this section or add an existing skill by selecting it from the list. Learn more about developing AI Skills: [Develop Creatio.ai Skill](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2535).\n## Step 3. Add AI Actions to the agent\u200b\nDefine the actions available to this agent in the **AI Actions** expanded list. Actions determine the specific operations the agent can perform in response to user requests. You can create a new action directly from the agent page if needed or select from existing actions. The agent can use system actions that are available for any agent or skill but cannot be added to skills or agents manually. Learn more: [Creatio.ai system actions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2550).\n## Step 4. Add attachments to the agent\u200b\nAI Agent can read the context and content of attached files. It can use this information to generate more accurate responses to user questions. Specify which file types the agent can work with in the **Attachments** expanded list. Supported file extensions: txt, docx, pdf, htm, css, scss, json, xhtml, md, tex, csv, tsv, log, sql, cs, ts, yaml, yml.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio.ai overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2528)\n[Creatio.ai architecture](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2548)\n[Creatio.ai system actions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2550)\n[Introduction to AI Agents](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2593)\n[AI Agent list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2592)\n[Data privacy in Creatio.ai](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2529)\n[Creatio AI (developer documentation)](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/category/creatio-ai)",
