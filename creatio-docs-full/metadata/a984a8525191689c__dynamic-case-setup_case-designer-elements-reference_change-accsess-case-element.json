  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nIf you want to add or remove access permissions to records in Creatio objects, use the **Change access rights** ![chapter_case_designer_icon_change_access_rights.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/chapter_case_designer_icon_change_access_rights.png) element. You can change access rights for multiple users or roles at the same time. To add or remove access sequentially, use several **Change Access Rights** elements.\n## Set up the Change access rights element\u200b\nSpecify the permission parameters on the element setup area (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 The Change access rights element setup area\n![Fig.\u00a01 The Change access rights element setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/chapter_case_designer_change_access_rights.png)\nThe name of the element is displayed at the top of the setup area. This makes the element easy to find on the case diagram.\nFill out the following fields:\n1. **When is the step performed?** \u2013 indicates whether to activate the element at the start of the stage or after a case step. Select \"At the start of the stage\" if the access rights must be changed at the start of the case stage. Select \"After the previous step is complete\" if the access rights must be changed after the previous step in the case stage. Specify the step in the **Perform after step** field.\n2. **Step type** \u2013 specify if the step is required. Select \"Required step\" if the task must be completed to transition to the next stage. If it is not required to perform change access rights to transition to the next stage, select \"Optional step.\"\nnote\nUsers can advance to the final \"unsuccessful\" stage from any stage without completing the required steps.\n3. In the **Which object to apply access rights to?** field, select the Creatio object for which you want to change permissions. Specify the filter conditions for records which you want to change access rights. For example, only for the \"VIP\" account records.\n## Remove access permissions\u200b\nAccess rights can be deleted for the user or all users, a certain role, as well as for several users selected via a filter.\nTo select users for whom you wish to delete access rights, click the ![btn_button_connections00007.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/btn_button_connections00007.png) button (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Select users for whom to remove access rights\n![Fig.\u00a02 Select users for whom to remove access rights](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/scr_chapter_process_designer_change_access_groups_users.png)\nThere are a few different options:\n* **For all roles and users** \u2013 delete permissions to the selected operations for all users and roles.\n* **For roles** \u2013 delete permissions for the selected organization structure item.\n* **For employee** \u2013 delete permissions for the user. To ensure the correct element operation, specify the contact of the user whose permissions you would like to delete.\n* **For the employees who meet the filter conditions** \u2013 delete permissions for all users that correspond to the filter conditions.\nTo delete or modify the selected role, click the ![btn_parametres_window_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/btn_parametres_window_edit.png) button and choose the action you want to perform from the menu.\nSelect the operations for which you would like to remove access rights \u2013 read ![chapter_case_designer_icon_access_rights_read.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/chapter_case_designer_icon_access_rights_read.png), edit ![chapter_case_designer_icon_access_rights_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/chapter_case_designer_icon_access_rights_edit.png), or delete ![chapter_case_designer_icon_access_rights_delete.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/chapter_case_designer_icon_access_rights_delete.png) data (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Removing access rights\n![Fig.\u00a03 Removing access rights](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_case_elements/scr_chapter_case_designer_change_access_operations.png)\nnote\nYou can delete access permissions to records for several different roles or users.
