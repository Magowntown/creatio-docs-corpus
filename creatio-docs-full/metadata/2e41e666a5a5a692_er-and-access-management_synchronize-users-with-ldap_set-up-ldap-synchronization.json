Users synchronized with LDAP can log in to Creatio using their domain credentials. Learn more in a separate article: [Set up LDAP authentication](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2366).\nCreatio supports synchronization with the following **LDAP servers** :\n* Active Directory. Learn more in the [official vendor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview).\n* OpenLDAP. Learn more in the [official vendor documentation](https://www.openldap.org/doc/).\nIn general, the LDAP synchronization setup consists of the following **steps** :\n1. Set up LDAP integration. Read more >>>\n2. Bind LDAP elements to Creatio users and roles. Read more >>>\n3. Run LDAP synchronization. Read more >>>\n## Set up LDAP integration\u200b\nSet up LDAP integration to enable the LDAP synchronization functionality. Perform the setup once, unless the LDAP directory structure changes. Basic knowledge about the structure of the needed LDAP directory is required to set up LDAP integration.\nImportant\nDepending on the structure of each LDAP directory, LDAP element attributes in your directory might differ from the attributes specified in the article.\nIn general, the LDAP integration setup consists of the following **steps** :\n1. Set up the LDAP server connection. Read more >>>\n2. Set up the user synchronization. Read more >>>\n3. Set up the synchronization between LDAP user groups and Creatio roles. Read more >>>\n4. Set up the filter conditions. Read more >>>\n### 1\\. Set up the LDAP server connection\u200b\n1. Click the ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/sys_settings_lookups/BPMonlineHelp/add_lookups/btn_system_designer.png) button to open the System Designer.\n2. Click \"LDAP integration setup\" in the \"Import and integration\" block. This opens a page.\n3. Specify the general **connection settings** of the LDAP server (Fig. 1 and 2):\n* Enter the LDAP server name or IP address in the **Server name** field.\n* Set the automatic LDAP synchronization interval in the **Synchronization interval (hours)** field. Learn more in a different section: [Set up the automatic synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1427&anchor=title-2392-21).\n* Select the connection protocol of the LDAP server in the **Authentication type** field. The authentication type depends on your LDAP server and the authentication security requirements. For example, select \"Ntlm\" for the NT LanManager authentication supported by Windows. You can use the default value.\nnote\nIf you select the \"Kerberos\" authentication type, the **Server name** and **Key Distribution Center** fields only support URLs, not IP addresses. Your Creatio application server must be joined to the same domain as the LDAP server and the key distribution center.\n* Select the **Synchronize only groups** checkbox to automatically deactivate and activate Creatio users that are manually excluded from and included in the synchronized groups in the LDAP directory. You can use the default value.\n* Select the **Grant licenses** checkbox to grant licenses to users on LDAP synchronization automatically. You can use the default value.\n* Select the **Use SSL** checkbox to enable SSL for the synchronization. If you select the checkbox, specify the value of the **Server name** field in the \"server:port\" format. You can use the default value. Creatio .NET Framework version 7.17.2 and later as well as Creatio .NET Core version 8.0.2 Atlas and later support LDAP server connection via the TLS 1.2 protocol.\nThe default port for LDAPS connection is 636.\nThe default port for LDAP connection is 389.\nnote\nIf you use self-signed certificate in Creatio cloud, use the extracted block service and send the certificate to [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) so that they can mark it as trusted.\n4. Specify the **authentication settings** (Fig. 1 and 2):\n* Enter the administrator credentials in the **Administrator login** , **Password** fields. If your Creatio server is installed on Linux, use the \"domain\\login\" format.\nnote\nMake sure that the administrator has sufficient permissions to read the user and group data.\nFig. 1 Connection settings of the LDAP server for Active Directory\n![Fig.\u00a01 Connection settings of the LDAP server for Active Directory](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_server_connection_general_settings_active_directory.png)\nFig. 2 Connection settings of the LDAP server for OpenLDAP\n![Fig.\u00a02 Connection settings of the LDAP server for OpenLDAP](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_server_connection_general_settings_openldap.png)\n### 2\\. Set up the user synchronization\u200b\n1. Map the **required** attributes of LDAP elements that contain the user data to import (Fig. 3 and 4):\n* Enter the unique name of the LDAP organizational structure element that contains the users to synchronize in the **Domain name** field. You can synchronize users subordinate to the specified LDAP element, either directly or to its child elements. For example, if you specify the root element of the directory structure, you can synchronize all users of the directory.\n* Specify the LDAP attribute that contains the full name of an LDAP user in the **User name** field. Required to populate the **Full name** field of the contact page when importing users. For example, the \"name\" or \"cn\" (\"Common Name\") attributes can contain the full name of the user. You can use the default value.\n* Specify the attribute that contains the LDAP username required to log in to Creatio in the **Username** field. The synchronized LDAP user will log in to Creatio using this name. For example, \"sAMAccountName.\" You can use the default value.\n* Specify the attribute that stores the time and date of the last change to the LDAP element in the **Modification date attribute** field. This lets you optimize the synchronization by excluding the previously imported records.\n* Specify the attribute that contains the unique user ID in the **User Id** field. You can use the default value.\nImportant\nIf any of the required user attributes are missing, LDAP integration throws an error.\n2. You can also map **optional** attributes Creatio uses to populate the fields on the user contact page (Fig. 3 and 4):\n* Specify the attribute that contains the user's email address in the **Email** field. Required to populate the **Email** field on the contact page. You can use the default value.\n* Specify the attribute that contains the name of the user's employer in the **Company name** field. Required to populate the **Account** field on the contact page. If an account name matches the value of the specified attribute verbatim, Creatio links the user\u2019s contact to that account during synchronization. You can use the default value.\n* Specify the attribute that contains the user's phone number in the **Phone number** field. Required to populate the **Business phone** field on the contact page. You can use the default value.\n* Specify the attribute that contains the user's job title in the **Job title** field. Required to populate the **Job title** field on the contact page. If an existing job title matches the value of the specified attribute verbatim, Creatio selects that job title for the user during synchronization. You can use the default value.\nnote\nCreatio does not add new organizations and job titles as part of the synchronization. Add them manually.\nImportant\nIf you leave any additional attribute fields empty, Creatio does not populate the corresponding contact page fields when importing users from LDAP.\nFig. 3 User attribute settings for Active Directory\n![Fig.\u00a03 User attribute settings for Active Directory](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_user_attributes_active_directory.png)\nFig. 4 User attribute settings for OpenLDAP\n![Fig.\u00a04 User attribute settings for OpenLDAP](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_user_attributes_openldap.png)\n### 3\\. Set up the synchronization between LDAP user groups and Creatio roles\u200b\nSet up the group synchronization to bind LDAP directory groups to elements of Creatio organizational structure.\nTo set up the synchronization between LDAP user groups and Creatio roles, map the required **attributes** of the LDAP directory elements that contain the user data to import (Fig. 5 and 6):\n* Specify the attribute that contains the name of the LDAP user group in the **LDAP group name** field. For example, the \"cn\" (\"Common Name\") attribute. You can use the default value.\n* Specify the unique name of the LDAP element that contains the user groups to synchronize in the **Groups domain name** field. You can synchronize groups subordinate to the specified LDAP element, either directly or to its child elements. For example, if you specify the root element of the directory structure, you can synchronize all groups of the directory.\n* Specify the attribute to use as a unique group ID in the **Group Id** field. You can use the default value.\nFig. 5 Settings of user group attributes for Active Directory\n![Fig.\u00a05 Settings of user group attributes for Active Directory](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_user_group_attributes_active_directory.png)\nFig. 6 Settings of user group attributes for OpenLDAP\n![Fig.\u00a06 Settings of user group attributes for OpenLDAP](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_user_group_attributes_openldap.png)\nCreatio verifies users included in the groups to synchronize as part of synchronization. If the date stored in the **Modification date attribute** attribute is later than the last synchronization date, Creatio updates the user entry in Creatio organizational structure.\nImportant\nIf any of these attributes are missing, LDAP integration throws an error.\n### 4\\. Set up the filter conditions\u200b\nSet up the filter conditions to specify which LDAP elements to include in the list of groups and users to synchronize.\nTo set up the filter conditions, specify the **general attributes** of the LDAP server connection (Fig. 7 and 8):\n* Specify the elements of the general LDAP directory index to synchronize with Creatio users in the **List of users** filter. The search filter must select active elements only. You can use the default value.\n* Specify the LDAP elements to synchronize with Creatio organizational roles (user groups) in the **List of groups** filter. The search filter must select active elements only. You can use the default value.\n* Build an index of users included in the LDAP group in the **List of group users** filter. One or more attributes determine whether a user is a member of a group. For example, most directories use the \"memberOf\" attribute. The (memberOf=[#LDAPGroupDN#]) filter contains a Creatio macro and lets you filter all objects (users) who are in the [#LDAPGroupDN#] group. You can use the default value.\nnote\nEnclose each logical expression in brackets () to ensure the filter works correctly both on Windows and Linux. Learn more in a separate article: [Set up Active Directory filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1868).\nFig. 7 Filter conditions for Active Directory\n![Fig.\u00a07 Filter conditions for Active Directory](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_search_data_active_directory.png)\nFig. 8 Filter conditions for OpenLDAP\n![Fig.\u00a08 Filter conditions for OpenLDAP](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/8.0/scr_search_data_openldap.png)\n## Bind LDAP elements to Creatio users and roles\u200b\nIn Creatio, you can synchronize the organizational and functional user roles with the Active Directory groups. After the LDAP synchronization, you can transfer the company organizational structure and role settings from Active Directory to Creatio.\nLDAP directory elements are bound to the corresponding Creatio elements (users and organizational structure elements) when you add new users or organizational roles. You can bind existing Creatio users or import users from Active Directory. Learn more in a separate article: [Import new users and roles from Active Directory](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1996).\nIn general, the procedure to bind LDAP elements to Creatio users and roles consists of the following **steps** :\n1. Set up the synchronization between Creatio organizational roles and Active Directory groups. Read more >>>\n2. Set up the synchronization between Creatio functional roles and Active Directory groups. Read more >>>\n3. Connect Creatio user accounts to LDAP users. Read more >>>\n### 1\\. Set up the synchronization between Creatio organizational roles and Active Directory groups\u200b\n1. Click the ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/sys_settings_lookups/BPMonlineHelp/add_lookups/btn_system_designer.png) button to open the System Designer.\n2. Click \"Organizational roles\" in the \"Users and administration\" block. This opens a page.\n3. Select the needed role from the organizational tree. If the tree lacks such a role, add it. Learn more in a separate article: [Organizational roles](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1434&anchor=title-2266-1).\nnote\nEach organizational role is an element in a tree-like structure of roles, where each element is an organization or a department.\n4. Open the **Users** tab and set the main parameters (Fig. 9):\n* Select the **Synchronize with LDAP** checkbox.\n* Select the Active Directory group that corresponds to the Creatio organizational role in the **LDAP element** field.\nFig. 9 Select the Active Directory group for the synchronization setup\n![Fig.\u00a09 Select the Active Directory group for the synchronization setup](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/chapter_ldap_synchronization_set_group.png)\n5. Add new users if needed. To do this, click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/btn_add_ke.png) button on the **Users** detail and select the users.\nnote\nTo synchronize a large number of users not yet registered in Creatio, we recommend importing the users from the LDAP directory. Learn more in a separate article: [Import new users and roles from Active Directory](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1996).\nAs a result, Creatio will synchronize the selected organizational role as part of the next synchronization session.\n### 2\\. Set up the synchronization between Creatio functional roles and Active Directory groups\u200b\n1. Click the ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/sys_settings_lookups/BPMonlineHelp/add_lookups/btn_system_designer.png) button to open the System Designer.\n2. Click \"Functional roles\" in the \"Users and administration\" block.\n3. Repeat [steps 3-5](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1427&anchor=title-2392-16) of the procedure to synchronize Creatio organizational roles with Active Directory groups.\n### 3\\. Connect Creatio user accounts to LDAP users\u200b\n1. Click the ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/sys_settings_lookups/BPMonlineHelp/add_lookups/btn_system_designer.png) button to open the System Designer.\n2. Click \"Organizational roles\" or \"Functional roles\" in the \"Users and administration\" block, depending on what user groups you would like to synchronize. This opens a page.\n3. Select the role of the needed user.\n4. Open the **Users** tab.\n5. Select the needed user and open their page.\n6. Open the **General information** tab and select **LDAP authentication**.\n7. Select the needed LDAP user in the **Login** field.\nFig. 10 Bind a user\n![Fig.\u00a010 Bind a user](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/chapter_ldap_synchronization_user_connect.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will connect the user to the LDAP user. The user will be able to log in to Creatio using credentials stored in the LDAP directory, such as the domain login and password.\n## Run the LDAP synchronization\u200b\nSynchronize Creatio users and organizational structure elements with the connected LDAP directory elements to update data in accordance with the LDAP directory changes made since the previous synchronization. As part of the synchronization, Creatio transfers changes made to users and groups in the LDAP directory to the corresponding connected organizational structure elements. Creatio lets you run the LDAP synchronization automatically or manually.\n### Set up the automatic LDAP synchronization\u200b\nCreatio runs the LDAP synchronization automatically at the interval specified in the **Synchronization interval (hours)** field of the LDAP integration setup page. Learn more in a different section: [Set up the LDAP server connection](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1427&anchor=title-2392-3).\nAfter you save the setup page, Creatio will start the LDAP integration automatically by running the \"Run LDAP import\" process (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Run LDAP import process\n![Fig.\u00a011 Run LDAP import process](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/scr_chapter_ldap_synchronization_process_log_launch_import.png)\n### Run the LDAP synchronization manually\u200b\n1. Click the ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/sys_settings_lookups/BPMonlineHelp/add_lookups/btn_system_designer.png) button to open the System Designer.\n2. Click \"Organizational roles\" in the \"Users and administration\" block. This opens a page.\n3. Select the **Synchronize with LDAP** action in the section action menu (Fig. 12). Fig. 12 Synchronize with LDAP action\n![Fig.\u00a012 Synchronize with LDAP action](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/scr_chapter_ldap_synchronization_process_org_roles_ldap_sync.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will run the \"Run LDAP synchronization\" process, which will, in turn, call the \"Synchronize user data with LDAP\" process (Fig. 13).\nFig. 13 Synchronize user data with LDAP and Run LDAP synchronization processes\n![Fig.\u00a013 Synchronize user data with LDAP and Run LDAP synchronization processes](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/LDAP/scr_chapter_ldap_synchronization_process_process_log_sync_users_data.png)\nCreatio will notify you when the synchronization is complete.\nnote\nIf the number of synchronized users exceeds the number of available licenses, Creatio notifies system administrators via the communication panel and email.\n## Special features of LDAP synchronization\u200b\n* If an LDAP user is no longer among the active users, Creatio clears the **Active** checkbox on the page of the synchronized user. The user will not be able to log in.\n* If a previously inactive LDAP user is activated, Creatio selects the **Active** checkbox on the page of the synchronized user.\n* If an LDAP user or user group is renamed, Creatio renames the synchronized users and roles.\n* If an LDAP user is excluded from an LDAP group linked to an element of Creatio organizational structure and the **Synchronize only groups** checkbox is selected, Creatio deactivates the user and excludes them from the corresponding organizational structure element.\n* If a LDAP user is added to an LDAP group linked to an element of Creatio organizational structure and the **Synchronize only groups** checkbox is selected, Creatio activates the user and adds them to the corresponding organizational structure element.\n* If you add new unsynchronized users to the synchronized LDAP element, Creatio imports the users.\n* If Creatio includes users (not imported from LDAP) whose names match LDAP user names, they are not synchronized.\n* If a synchronized LDAP user is deleted from a group connected to a Creatio organizational structure element, the user remains active in Creatio, but they will not be able to log in.\n* If the **Grant licenses** checkbox is selected, Creatio grants licenses to the synchronized users. Learn more in a different section: [Set up the LDAP server connection](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1427&anchor=title-2392-3).\nAs a result of the LDAP synchronization, the users will be able to use their credentials to log in to Creatio.
