  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nCreatio can be integrated with any identity provider that supports the Open ID protocol. You can use Cognito AWS portal as a single sign-on point for all your services, including Creatio. To do this, perform he setup both in Cognito AWS and Creatio.\nThe following **steps** are the general procedure required to set up Single Sign-On in Creatio:\n1. Sign up for [Cognito AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).\n2. Perform the setup in Cognito AWS. Read more >>>\n3. Perform the setup in Creatio. Read more >>>\n## Perform the setup in Cognito AWS\u200b\n1. Sign in to Aws.Amazon as root user.\n2. Click **App client list** \u2192 **Create app client**.\n3. Enter \"Creatio\" in the **App client list** field.\n4. Click **Client secret** \u2192 **Generate a client secret**.\n5. Enter `[CreatioURL]/ServiceModel/AuthService.svc/OpenIdCallback` in **Allowed callback URLs** where [CreatioURL] is the URL of your Creatio instance.\n6. Enter `[CreatioURL]/ServiceModel/AuthService.svc/OpenIdLogoutCallback` in **Allowed sign-out URLs** where [CreatioURL] is the URL of your Creatio instance.\n7. Select **Email** , **OpenId** , **Phone** , **Profile** in the **OpenID Connect scopes** block.\nFig. 1 OpenID Connect scopes block\n![Fig.\u00a01 OpenID Connect scopes block](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/Cognito_integration/scr_chapter_single_sign_on_Cognito_step3_set_site.png)\n8. Click **Create app client**.\n9. **Save the following data** from Cognito AWS console to your machine:\nParameter| Parameter Value  \n---|---  \nClient ID| The ID of the client. Consists of 26 letters and digits. To find this value, open the **App integration** section \u2192 **App client list**.  \nClient Secret| The secret of the client. Consists of 52 letters and digits. To find this value, open the **App integration** section \u2192 **App clients and analytics** block \u2192 click the name of your application.  \nUser pool ID| The pool ID of the User. View the value in the settings of a specific user pool.  \nRegion| The region of the user. Matches the \"Region\" parameter in the \"User pool ID\" value. For example, `User pool ID = cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_123456789`, where us-east-1 is the required region. Learn more in [Cognito documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-integrating-user-pools-with-identity-pools.html).  \n## Perform the setup in Creatio\u200b\nnote\nIf you use Creatio **in the cloud** , the Open ID authorization is enabled out of the box.\nTo evaluate Open ID authorization in Creatio **on-site** , enable the \"EnableOpenIDAuth\" additional feature. Instructions: [Change the status of an additional feature for all users](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15631&anchor=title-3459-3) (developer documentation).\nFollow these steps to configure single sign-on in Creatio:\n1. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/adfs_integration/8_0/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) button to open the **System Designer**.\n2. Click **Single Sign On configuration**.\n3. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/adfs_integration/8_0/btn_add_record.png). This opens a drop-down menu.\n4. Select \"Cognito AWS.\" This opens the setup page.\n5. Fill out the following parameters:\nParameter| Parameter Value  \n---|---  \nClient ID| The ID of the client. Consists of 26 letters and digits. To find this value, retrieve it from Cognito AWS in the **Client ID** parameter.  \nClient Secret| The secret of the client. Consists of 52 letters and digits. To find this value, retrieve it from CognitoAWS in the **Client secret** parameter.  \nURL| The URL of your provider\u2019s website. The URL template is as follows `https://[userPoolId].auth.[Region].amazoncognito.com`. [Region] and [UserPoolId] are \"Region\" and \"User pool ID\" values retrieved from Cognito AWS console, respectively.  \nDiscovery URL| The URL of the identity provider\u2019s single sign-on. The URL template looks like `https://cognito-idp.[region].amazonaws.com/[userPoolId]/.well-known/openid-configuration`. [Region] and [UserPoolId] are \"Region\" and \"User pool ID\" values retrieved from Cognito AWS console, respectively.  \nEnd session endpoint| The URL of the identity provider\u2019s single sign-off. The URL template is as follows `https://[userPoolId].auth.[region].amazoncognito.com/logout?client_id={client_id}&logout_uri={redirect_uri}&state={state}`. [Region] and [UserPoolId] are \"Region\" and \"User pool ID\" values retrieved from Cognito AWS console, respectively.  \n6. **Fill out the provider name** to display on the Creatio login page in the **Display name** field.\n7. **Save the changes**.\n8. **Turn on Just-In-Time Provisioning** (optional). This mechanism automatically creates the corresponding Creatio user account with data from the identity provider, such as user group, employee name, contact information, etc. For company employees, select the **Create and update company employees data when log in (Just-In-Time Provisioning)** checkbox and map the fields. For external users, select the **Create and update external users data when log in (Just-In-Time Provisioning)** checkbox and map the fields (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Set up Just-In-Time Provisioning\n![Fig.\u00a02 Set up Just-In-Time Provisioning](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/adfs_integration/8_0/scr_set_up_JIT_updated.png)\n## Set up SSO authentication for Mobile Creatio\u200b\nMobile Creatio lets you log in using the Single Sign-On technology. To set up SSO authentication for Mobile Creatio, **turn on the \"Use SSO in the mobile app\" (\"MobileUseSSO\" code) system setting**.\nIf the **SSO authentication for Mobile Creatio is turned on** , the app displays an identity provider page that includes the login and password fields.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Single Sign-On via ADFS](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1649)\n[Just-In-Time User Provisioning](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1759)",
