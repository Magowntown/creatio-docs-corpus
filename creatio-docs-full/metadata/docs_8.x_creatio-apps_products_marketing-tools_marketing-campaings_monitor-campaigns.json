  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Marketing\nOn this page\nYou can monitor the flow of your campaigns using campaign log. To open the log, click ![btn_more.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/monitor_campaigns/btn_more.png) \u2192 **Progress check** in the **Campaigns** section.\nThe list view of the campaign log (Fig. 1) displays information on campaign element execution.\nFig. 1 Campaign log list\n![Fig.\u00a01 Campaign log list](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/monitor_campaigns/scr_campaign_progress_check.png)\nThe log contains information on elements from all campaigns. After you start a campaign, its events will start appearing in the campaign log. The campaign log is activated automatically and does not require additional setup.\n## Campaign log list\u200b\nEach record in the list is a separate log event. Log data is displayed as a list of records that contain the following columns:\nCampaign| The name of the campaign where the log event occurred. Click the campaign name to open the corresponding record in the **Campaigns** section.  \n---|---  \nAction| The name of the logged action type.  \nStep| The name of the [campaign element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1487) in the Campaign Designer that triggered the logged action.  \nStatus| Status of the campaign execution step (\"Success\" or \"Error\").  \nParticipants| Number of participants involved in the logged action.  \nStart date| Start and end dates of the actual campaign execution step. Depending on the action type, it can be: start or end of the campaign (for \"Campaign execution\" actions), start/end dates of a campaign element execution (for \"Element execution: <Campaign element type>\" actions) or date of adding and removing campaign participants manually (for \"Participant adding (manually)\" action).  \nEnd date  \nError details| If the status is \"Error\", the field displays the error message that can help with diagnosing and resolving the campaign errors.  \n## Types of logged campaign actions\u200b\nCreatio logs the following types of campaign actions:\nCampaign execution| Indicates the start of a campaign. The first action logged for any campaign.  \n---|---  \nElement execution: <Campaign element type>| Indicates execution of a campaign element or flow on the campaign diagram.  \nParticipant adding (manually)| Indicates manual adding of a participant to the campaign.  \n## Monitor counters on the campaign flow tab\u200b\nOnce you create a campaign flow in the Campaign Designer, the **Campaign flow** tab of the campaign page will display the campaign diagram with participant counters for every campaign element, as well as a set of checkboxes that enable different types of counters (Fig. 2). The color of the checkbox is the same as the color of the respective counter.\nFig. 2 Participant counter filters on the Campaign flow tab\n![Fig.\u00a02 Participant counter filters on the Campaign flow tab](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/monitor_campaigns/scr_new_counters.png)\n* **All** : select to view the number of participants on all steps.\n* **Complete** : select to view the number of participants on a step that completed successfully. These participants are queued to transfer to subsequent campaign step(s).\n* **Incomplete** : select to view the number of participants on a step they reached but are yet to complete. These participants are usually delayed by a conditional flow.\n* **In progress** : select to view the number of participants on the step which is being executed at the moment.\n* **Error** : select to view the number of participants on a step in which the error occurred.\n* **Suspended** : select to view the number of participants on a step in which their participation was suspended. These participants are likely set to re-enter the campaign.\n* **History** : displays the total number of participants who reached this step since the start of the campaign.\nIf you add new participants to a campaign at different time, use the **filter by date** to find out how many participants were added to the campaign at a specified period and what their current step is. The filters by date are available when the counters are enabled. The counters display only the contacts added during the specified period: \"today\" (![btn_com_filter_day.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/marketing_campaigns/BPMonlineHelp/monitor_campaigns/btn_com_filter_day.png)), \"current week\" (![btn_com_filter_week.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/marketing_campaigns/BPMonlineHelp/monitor_campaigns/btn_com_filter_week.png)) or custom period (![btn_com_menu_period.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/marketing_campaigns/BPMonlineHelp/monitor_campaigns/btn_com_menu_period.png)).\nTo edit the campaign diagram, click **Edit**.\n## Monitor participants on the Audience tab\u200b\nThe tab displays all campaign participants (contacts), their current steps on the campaign diagram and status (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Audience tab\n![Fig.\u00a03 Audience tab](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/monitor_campaigns/scr_audience.png)\nThe period when the list of participants is available on the **Audience** tab is configured in the **Start mode** field on the campaign page. If you select \"manual,\" Creatio displays the list as soon as the campaign starts. If you select \"at the specified time,\" Creatio displays the list of participants on the **Participants** tab at the first launch of the campaign according to the schedule. The list will not be displayed until the campaign starts.\nView the primary columns on the **Audience** tab in the table below.\nContact| Full name of the campaign participant.  \n---|---  \nCurrent step| Campaign step (campaign element) the participant is currently on.  \nStatus| The status of the campaign participant: \"Participating\" or \"Exited.\"The \"Participating\" status indicates that the contact continues to advance through the steps of the campaign.The \"Exited the campaign\" status indicates that the contact no longer participates in the campaign.  \nStep completed| \"Yes\" or \"No\", depending on the participant\u2019s execution of the corresponding step of the campaign. For example, clicked the email link or filled out the web-form.  \nStep completed on| Date and time when the participant completed the step.  \nStep modified on| Date and time when the participant advanced to the step, specified in the **Current step** column.  \n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Add campaign](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1074)\n[Set up campaign diagram](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1740)\n[Campaign element reference](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1487)",
