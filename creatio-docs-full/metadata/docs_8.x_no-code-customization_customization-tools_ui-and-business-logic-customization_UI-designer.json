  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\n**Freedom UI Designer** is a visual drag-and-drop editor that lets you create and set up a fully responsive app layout (including mobile). You can create UIs from ready layout templates, such as pages with tabs and dashboards. You can also create a custom UI of any structure from scratch. Set up the pages in the new Freedom UI framework, which lets you modify the appearance of elements, manage data sources, and place page components arbitrarily.\nWork in the Freedom UI Designer using no-code tools. UI design involves structuring the page with layout elements: tabs, areas, and columns. Depending on the information you want to display on the page, you can also set up charts, add fields, lists, buttons, and other components.\nnote\nWe recommend using Freedom UI Designer in Google Chrome instead of Safari to take full advantage of Freedom UI Designer capabilities.\nTo begin with the setup of Freedom UI pages, click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/btn_edit_page.png) button in the top right of the current app page \u2192 **Edit page**.\nThis opens the Freedom UI Designer (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Freedom UI Designer\n![Fig.\u00a01 Freedom UI Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_freedom_ui_designer.png)\n**Element library (1)**. The library contains the tools required to set up a custom UI.\n**Action panel (2)**. Use the action panel to save the page design, cancel the changes, set up the business rules, open the source code and page property settings.\n**Canvas (3)**. The working area of the Freedom UI Designer. Drag elements from the library to the canvas to set up the page structure.\n**Setup area (4)**. Use the setup area to manage the properties of visual components, the behavior of buttons, expansion panels, charts, etc. Learn more about the settings in the description of each element. To open the setup area, double-click the relevant element or select the element on the canvas and click .\n### UI Designer elements\u200b\nView the elements of the Designer in the table below:\nElement types| Description  \n---|---  \nData| Element group that manages the page data source: the object of the section where the page is located.  \nCharts| Elements that visualize statistics. The following chart types are available: spline, line, bar, doughnut, area, column, scatter, pipeline, sales pipeline, full pipeline, metric, gauge.  \nComponents| Elements that execute target page actions and solve a number of other problems: button, label, list, folders, action panel, etc.  \nLayout elements| Elements that structure the page: expansion panels, tabs, toggle panels, grid containers, flex containers.  \n## Data\u200b\nApps can contain pages that have different data sources. For example, a data source for a record page is a specific object. Creatio adds a data source automatically when you create an app. You can add an existing source or create a new source when you add an app page.\nTo add a new data source:\n1. Click **Add data source**.\n2. Select \"New data source.\" This opens a window.\n3. Fill out the **Name** and **Description** fields of the data source in the window.\nAs a result, Creatio will add an object and connect it to the page as a data source. The Freedom UI Designer will display the data source in the **Data** group. The **Code** field will be populated automatically (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Data in the Freedom UI Designer\n![Fig.\u00a02 Data in the Freedom UI Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/designer_interfaces_new_source.png)\nYou can display data and enable users to enter data using fields and inputs.\n### Fields\u200b\nUse fields to display data and enable users to enter data. When you set up fields, Creatio adds and modifies the corresponding attributes of the data model. After you set up a field and save the page, you can remove the field from the canvas without removing the corresponding attributes of the data model. To add existing fields to the page, drag them from the **Data** area to the relevant part of the canvas.\nCreatio specifies the data source automatically. You can change it in the **Advanced** section of the field setup area if needed. If the new data source is a different attribute of the page data model, the field on the canvas changes to the field bound to the specified attribute. If the new data source is an attribute of a related object, Freedom UI Designer converts the field to an input.\nYou can add the following field types to the page in the UI Designer:\n* **Text**. Enables users to enter letters, digits, and other characters.\n* **Number**. Enables users to enter integers or fractions.\n* **Checkbox**. Enables users to select either of the two values: \"True\" or \"False.\" \"True\" value is a selected checkbox.\n* **Date/Time**. Enables users to select date and/or time, depending on the selected format.\n* **Rich text**. Enables users to enter rich text content, including clickable links, images, and tables. For example, this is useful for writing comments or knowledge base articles.\n* **Phone**. Enables users to enter phone numbers. Functionally identical to the \"Phone number\" format type of the text field. Can apply the phone number pattern. If Creatio is integrated with a phone service, users can click the phone number to initiate a call from the communication panel. Otherwise, clicking the field runs the application that handles phone calls.\n* **Email**. Enables users to enter email addresses as clickable \"mailto:\" links that are opened by the default email client. Can validate the email address format.\n* **Web link**. Enables users to enter clickable URLs.\n* **Dropdown**. Enables users to select values from a set list of options stored in a lookup or other data source. You can add a new lookup object when you add this field.\n* **Color**. Enables users to specify a color value. For example, this is useful for product pages.\n* **Autonumber**. Numbers new records automatically starting from 1, both when a user adds a record and a business process or integration add it. You can set the number prefix and change the quantity of digits in the number. Creatio reserves the number when you click a button that adds records. When you click a button that adds records again, Creatio reserves the subsequent number, even if the previous record was not saved.\n* **Image**. Enables users to upload or view images. Can display images from different sources, for example, Creatio database or CDN.\n* **Encrypted string**. Enables users to enter sensitive data and store it securely, for example, credit card or social security numbers.\nThe Freedom UI Designer supports various properties that provide flexible field setup options. Learn more about setting up fields in a separate guide: [Fields and inputs](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/fields-and-inputs).\nFig. 3 Dropdown field\n![Fig.\u00a03 Dropdown field](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_dropdown_field.png)\n### Inputs\u200b\nUse **Input** layout elements to display data and enable users to enter data. When you set up inputs, Creatio does not modify the attributes of the data model.\nSpecify the data source manually in the **Advanced** section of the input setup area. Inputs accept data from attributes of related objects. If you specify an attribute of the page data model, Freedom UI Designer converts the input on the canvas to a field.\nInput setup is mostly similar to the field setup. However, input setup does not modify the structure of the data model.\nYou can set up inputs connected to the same page field differently. This includes settings in the element setup area and conditional properties defined by business rules.\nThe input types you can add correspond to field types except for the unique **Slider** input. It displays an integer within a range and enables users to slide the value up and down with a preset step value. Learn more about setting up the **Slider** in a separate article: [Set up a Slider input](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2442).\nFig. 4 Slider input\n![Fig.\u00a04 Slider input](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_slider.png)\n## Charts\u200b\nChart functionality in Freedom UI is mostly similar to [analytics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2144) in the **Dashboard** section of the main Creatio application. However, Freedom UI charts have some unique features:\n* You can connect all charts except \"Sales pipeline\" and \"Full pipeline\" to lists, approval lists, or attachment lists. This filters chart data by records displayed in the connected component or the record selected in the list. For example, this lets you display data in case charts only for open cases.\nFig. 5 Charts connected to a list\n![Fig.\u00a05 Charts connected to a list](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_charts_connected_to_list.gif)\n* You can filter all charts except \"Sales pipeline\" and \"Full pipeline\" using the **Quick filter** component. For example, this lets you display data in case charts only for a particular agent.\nFig. 6 Filtering charts using the quick lookup filter\n![Fig.\u00a06 Filtering charts using the quick lookup filter](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_chart_lookup_filter.gif)\n* When you drill down chart data, you can customize the data list similarly to a Freedom UI section list as well as search for specific records (Fig. 7). Learn more about customizing Freedom UI lists in a separate article: [Manage a list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2402).\nFig. 7 Drilling down chart data\n![Fig.\u00a07 Drilling down chart data](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_drill_down.gif)\n* You can export chart data to Excel to process data easier. To do this, expand the dashboard and select **Export to Excel** in the context menu. The browser will download the data file to your computer (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Exporting chart data to Excel\n![Fig.\u00a08 Exporting chart data to Excel](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_export_to_excel.gif)\n* For charts that have multiple series, you can customize the header color and series color individually. Use the **Chart color** and **Style** fields to do this, respectively (optional) (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Setting up a chart that has several series\n![Fig.\u00a09 Setting up a chart that has several series](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_home_page/page_wizard_set_dashboard.gif)\n* You can select from several fill options in the **Chart style** field for \"Metric\" and \"Chart\" dashboard headings (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Setting up the chart heading style\n![Fig.\u00a010 Setting up the chart heading style](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_home_page/set_up_dashboard_style.gif)\n* The \"Pie chart\" type is replaced with the \"Doughnut chart\" type. Set up this chart similar to the pie chart (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Doughnut chart\n![Fig.\u00a011 Doughnut chart](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_home_page/dashboard_donut.png)\n* You can filter chart and metric data by the parameters of their location page. Configure the filter in the **How to associate with page data** field group. The setup process is similar to the **How to associate with section data** field group. For example, you can set up a budget composition chart on a request page and limit the chart data to the request whose page the user opens.\n* You can specify whether to display values of individual bars and columns on \"Bar\" and \"Column\" chart types, respectively.\n## Components\u200b\n### Button\u200b\nUse the **Button** component to execute a page action. The following actions are available:\n* **Open new record**. Opens the form page of a new record that belongs to any Creatio object. You can create and edit the form page for any Creatio object as part of the button setup. It is possible to set different form pages for new records and existing records, for example, a mini page and full page, respectively. If different record types use different pages, for example, **Activities** section, you can specify the page to open.\nThe action can also populate the form page fields with specific values if needed.\n* **Open existing record**. Opens the form page of a specific record that belongs to any Creatio object. You can create and edit the form page for any Creatio object as part of the button setup. It is possible to set different form pages for new records and existing records, for example, a mini page and full page, respectively. If different record types use different pages, for example, the **Activities** section, you can specify the page to open.\n* **Open specific page**. Opens any Freedom UI page, including list pages, mini pages, and homepages. You can create and edit the page to open as part of the button setup.\n* **Open duplicates page**. Searches for duplicate records and displays the found duplicates on a separate page. You can connect the button to any section that supports the duplicate search functionality.\n* **Open change log**. Opens the change log for a selected record or an object.\n* **Save data**. Saves changes without closing the page. Applies to all page data sources, for example, fields and editable lists. You can customize the text of the record save notification or disable it. If the record creation flow on pages added in Creatio version 8.2.2 and later includes only a full-sized page, you can let users stay on the full-sized page after they create a record and save changes.\n* **Cancel changes**. Cancels changes without closing the page. Applies to all page data sources, for example, fields and editable lists.\n* **Refresh data**. Refreshes data of a list object, attachment list, approval list, or gallery without refreshing the entire page. You can specify which data sources to refresh. Since dependent data sources and sources created live are always refreshed, they are not displayed in the list of data sources to refresh.\n* **Close page**. Returns to the previous Creatio page the browser tab had open. If the previous page is not a Creatio page, opens the Creatio desktop. If the current page is the first page the browser tab has open, returns to an empty tab.\n* **Run process**. Runs the latest version of a business process. You can create and edit the process to run as part of the button setup. The button can save the page before running the process.\n* **Delete data**. Deletes selected records from the **List** component that has multiselect turned on.\n* **Upload file**. Uploads a file to an attachment list. You can select from attachment lists that are present on the page. The upload mechanism is pre-configured and non-editable.\n* **Add tags**. Adds tags to records selected in the **List** component.\n* **Remove tags**. Removes tags from records selected in the **List** component.\n* **Add records to static folder**. Adds records selected in the **List** component to a static folder.\n* **Remove records from static folder**. Removes records selected in the **List** component from a static folder.\n* **Add communication option**. Adds a communication option to the **Communication options** component. The action is available only if you have **Customer 360** app installed.\n* **Data import**. Imports data to any Creatio object. The import mechanism is pre-configured and non-editable.\n* **Export to Excel**. Downloads list data as an *.xlsx file. You can select from lists that are present on the page except for attachment lists. The export mechanism is pre-configured and non-editable.\n* **Set up access rights**. Configures access permissions to the form page where the button is placed. Works only on form pages. The permission setup mechanism is pre-configured and non-editable.\n* **Set calendar time scale**. Changes the time scale of the **Calendar** component to the specified value.\n* **Show record's relationship**. Opens the relationship chart of an account or contact record.\n* **Add calendar synchronization account**. Adds an Office 365 or Google mailbox whose calendar to automatically synchronize with Creatio.\n* **Set up calendar synchronization account**. Opens the mailbox calendar synchronization settings.\n* **Send invite**. Enables meeting organizers to send calendar invitations to meeting participants. Requires calendar synchronization to be configured.\n* **Continue in other page**. Opens the default form page for the data source without saving the record yet. This is particularly useful for mini pages.\n* **Print report**. Generates a printable report file. Learn more: [Set up Microsoft Word report - general procedure](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1247).\n* **Creatio.ai action**. Activates a Creatio.ai action specified in the prompt in the button settings.\n* **Create an email**. Opens the mini page that contains **message composer**. The action lets you define connections to add automatically when an email is sent. For example, link the email activity sent from the case to the account and contact related to the case.\nYou can customize button caption, visual style, and size as well as add an icon to a button. You can also set up multi-level button menus. A menu item title can contain text, an icon, or both. You can copy existing menu items to accelerate the setup process. You can also copy existing buttons together with their settings.\nLearn more about setting up buttons in a separate article: [Set up Button components](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2401).\nFig. 12 Button component\n![Fig.\u00a012 Button component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_button.png)\n### List\u200b\nUse the **List** component to add a list of the selected object\u2019s data based on pre-configured filters.\nYou can connect lists to other page components that work with data. This includes approval lists, attachment lists, other lists, or charts except \"Sales pipeline\" and \"Full pipeline.\" The connected components filter their data by records displayed in the list. For example, this lets you filter the list of cases by the list of displayed agents. Components can be linked via direct connection, for example, the city of a contact. If you connect a list to another list, you can also filter data by the record selected in the list.\nUsers can add, hide, freeze, and resize list columns while working in an app. Creatio saves the list settings in the user profile, therefore the settings are applied every time an app is opened. It is also possible to apply list settings to every app user. Restore the default settings in a single click via the **Reset to default settings** button. Learn more about managing lists in a separate article: [Manage a list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2402).\nLearn more about setting up lists in a separate article: [Set up List components](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2457).\nFig. 13 List component\n![Fig.\u00a013 List component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_freedom_ui_list.png)\n### Expanded list\u200b\n**Expanded list** is an **Expansion panel** layout element that has **List** , **Search** , and multiple **Button** components that control the list attached. Once you select a list object, Freedom UI Designer automatically links the **Search** component and buttons to the object. The title of the expansion panel is updated automatically as well provided that you have not changed the title manually. Otherwise, setup process of the expansion panel and components attached to it is identical to standalone elements.\nFig. 14 Expanded list component\n![Fig.\u00a014 Expanded list component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_expanded_list.png)\n### Label\u200b\nUse the **Label** component to add arbitrary text to the page, create individual headings for element groups, or display data of the current user contact. Learn more about setting up labels in a separate article: [Set up a Label component](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2433).\nFig. 15 Label component\n![Fig.\u00a015 Label component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_label.png)\n### Folders\u200b\nUse the **Folders** component to configure the folder structure that segments records by the specified filters. If you create a Freedom UI app for an object that has a Classic UI section, you can reuse folders of the Classic UI section in the Freedom UI **Folders** component. This streamlines the migration of Classic UI sections to Freedom UI.\nManage Freedom UI folders similarly to folders in the classic Creatio UI. Learn more in a separate article: [Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1018).\nFig. 16 Folders component\n![Fig.\u00a016 Folders component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_folders.png)\n### Folder management menu\u200b\nUse the **Folder management menu** component to enable users to open the page folder tree as well as reach favorite folders quickly. If the page contains the **Folders** component without the management menu, users will be unable to reopen the folder tree after closing it.\nFig. 17 Folder management menu component\n![Fig.\u00a017 Folder management menu component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_folder_management_menu.gif)\n### Communication options\u200b\nThe component is available if you have **Customer 360** app installed.\nUse the **Communication options** component to enable users to manage record communication options, for example, email, phone, and web link.\nThe component comprises **Expansion panel** , **Button** , **Flex container** , **Grid container** , and **Communication options** componets. Setup procedure for all components except for **Communication options** is identical to standalone elements.\nFig. 18 Communication options component\n![Fig.\u00a018 Communication options component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_communication_options.png)\n### Feed\u200b\nUse the **Feed** component to enable internal and external users to post and read comments that support rich text and user mention via \"@.\" Authors can edit or delete their posts or attachments. You can select between the following feed types:\n* \"Record.\" Display posts and comments connected to a specific record. For example, a lead.\n* \"User.\" Display the index of posts and comments that mention the current user or those to which the user is subscribed.\nFig. 19 Feed component\n![Fig.\u00a019 Feed component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_feed.png)\n### Action dashboard\u200b\nnote\nThe component is available in Creatio version 8.0.8 and earlier. Action dashboards are still available on existing pages in Creatio version 8.0.9 and later, but you cannot add them to new pages. Instead, use **Progress bar** and **Next steps** components that let you set up user workflow much more flexibly. Learn more about the components in different sections: Progress bar, Next steps.\nUse the **Action dashboard** component to edit the dynamic case that organizes the workflow in the app. You can define the list of actions users can execute directly from the page using a mini page, for example, schedule a task, write an email, summarize the call results, post a message in the record feed.\nIf the data source is specified in the element setup area (for example, when you add an action dashboard to the canvas, Freedom UI Designer sets the element data source to the page data source automatically), click the **Set up cases** button to open the Case Designer. Specify the case stages, as well as steps and tasks required to complete the case in the Designer. Learn more in a separate guide: [Case Designer workflows](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/case-designer-workflows).\nFig. 20 Action dashboard component\n![Fig.\u00a020 Action dashboard component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_action_dashboard.png)\n### Attachments\u200b\nUse the **Attachments** component to enable users to upload and download files. You can bind the files to the current record or related objects. You can also tag specific attachments to filter them or display multiple attachment lists on a single page, for example, required request files and additional request files.\nThe component comprises **Expansion panel** , **Button** , **Flex container** , and **Attachment list** components. Setup procedure for all components except for the **Attachment list** is identical to standalone components. Learn more in separate articles: [Set up an Attachments component](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2434), [Work with attachments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1297).\nFig. 21 Attachments component\n![Fig.\u00a021 Attachments component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_attachments.png)\n### Multiselect lookup\u200b\nUse the **Multiselect lookup** component to select multiple items from a lookup and display them as a chip list. This is useful for implementing many-to-many relationships where you need to select and visually manage multiple values as well as for cases where you need to display only one column from the selected object. For example, activity participants. Learn more about setting up multiselect lookups in a separate article: [Set up a Multiselect lookup component](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2606).\nFig. 22 Multiselect lookup component\n![Fig.\u00a022 Multiselect lookup component](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_multiselect_lookup.png)\n### Gallery\u200b\nUse the **Gallery** component to display visual data of any Creatio object on a page. For example, you can display the index of meeting participants or order products as a gallery. Besides images, you can display record caption and brief description text in the gallery (Fig. 23).\nFig. 23 Gallery component\n![Fig.\u00a023 Gallery component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_gallery.png)\n### Approvals\u200b\nUse the **Approvals** component to enable users to approve or deny records. You can hide the component from the page if the current user has no approvals assigned to them.\nThe component behavior is pre-configured and non-editable. After you add the component to the page, set up the approval mechanism in a business process or case. Learn more in separate articles: [Configure a document approval process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2363), [Set up an approval case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2328).\nFig. 24 Approvals component\n![Fig.\u00a024 Approvals component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_approvals.png)\n### Approvals list\u200b\nUse the **Approvals list** component to enable users to view the entire approval process of a specific record as a list to ensure transparency. The component is an **Expansion panel** element that has **Approvals list** , **Search** , and multiple **Button** components attached. The setup process of the expansion panel and most components attached to it is identical to standalone components. The behavior of the **Approvals list** component is pre-configured and non-editable.\nFig. 25 Approvals list component\n![Fig.\u00a025 Approvals list component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_approvals_list.png)\n### Progress bar\u200b\nUse the **Progress bar** component to enable users to track and change case stages. The element is connected to the page data source automatically. Click the **Set up cases** button to open the Case Designer. Specify the case stages as well as steps and tasks required to complete the case in the Designer. Learn more in a separate guide: [Case Designer workflows](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/case-designer-workflows).\nFig. 26 Progress bar component\n![Fig.\u00a026 Progress bar component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_progress_bar.png)\n### Next steps\u200b\nUse the **Next steps** component to view and manage activities and tasks for the current record as tiles. The activities and tasks can be generated by cases or added manually. The component completes activities and displays new activities based on the stage in the **Progress bar** component. You can connect activities of emails sent using the component to the value of a data model attribute and activity column if needed. The component also lets you do the following:\n* add a task or email\n* complete an activity manually\n* approve a record\n* view the task owner and open their contact page\nThe component comprises **Expansion panel** , **Button** , **Flex container** , **Grid container** , and **Next steps** components. Setup procedure for all components except for **Next steps** is identical to standalone elements. The behavior of the **Next steps** component is pre-configured and non-editable.\nFig. 27 Next steps component\n![Fig.\u00a027 Next steps component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_next_steps.png)\n### Search\u200b\nUse the **Search** component to enable users to search for records by all visible columns or specific visible columns in any Freedom UI list, attachment list, or approval list. The **Expanded list** and **Approvals list** components include the component by default.\nFig. 28 Search component\n![Fig.\u00a028 Search component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_search.gif)\n### Quick filter\u200b\nUse the **Quick filter** component to enable users to filter the values of any list, calendar, or chart except for \"Sales pipeline\" and \"Full pipeline\" by a manually defined condition, date/time range, or the value of any lookup.
