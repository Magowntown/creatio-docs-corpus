  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Sales Enterprise\nOn this page\nField Sales for Creatio manages a sales rep\u2019s \"to-do\" list during the visits and records results of each activity. For that, the sales rep uses a mobile device with Creatio mobile app. We recommend that sales reps use tablets for the best experience when working in the field. Visit pages are most informative when viewed in the horizontal layout.\nImportant\nOnly the users included to the \"Sales representatives\" role can use the field features in the mobile app.\nThe list of actions that must be performed during a visit is stored on the **Visit actions** detail of the visit page. For example, according to the rule of the visit, the visit agenda of a sales rep is as follows: check in, do a presentation, place an order for the next batch of products and check out.\nTo complete an item on a visit agenda:\n1. Open the visit page.\n2. On the **Visit action** detail, toggle the switcher next to the corresponding action to the \"Completed\" position.  \nThe switcher of a completed action is highlighted in blue.\nAs a result, the visit action will be considered completed. You can finish the visit once all required actions are completed (you can skip optional visit actions). A field employee cannot complete a required action unless all preceding required actions on the agenda have been completed. Once the last required action is completed, the visit is considered finished. The action that is not required can be skipped.\nAll visit actions are available in the [offline mode](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=mobile&ver=7&id=1390) of the mobile app. When working offline, you do not need to maintain a constant Internet connection. It is required to periodically synchronize the mobile application with the main application to save the changes made when using the mobile device on the Creatio server.\nTo synchronize the mobile app with the primary Creatio application:\n1. Make sure that the mobile device has established an Internet connection.\n2. Open the **Settings** section of the mobile application.\n3. Click the **Synchronization** button.\nAs a result, the data from the primary application will be displayed in the mobile app and the primary application will display the records that were created using the mobile app.\n## Do a presentation\u200b\nIf the visit agenda requires conducting a presentation, the \"Presentation\" action ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_55607_165)) becomes available to the employee. As a result, a Microsoft PowerPoint file will open in your mobile app, so you can use it during the presentation. Learn more: [Set up rules and actions of a field meeting](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1375#title-1601-3).\nFig. 1 Performing the Presentation action\n![Fig.\u00a01 Performing the Presentation action](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/scr_field_force_open_presentation.png)\n## Place an order\u200b\nTo place an order, on the **Visit actions** detail of the mobile app, perform the \"Order placement\" action ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_10460_188)).\nFig. 1 Placing the order\n![Fig.\u00a01 Placing the order](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/scr_field_force_order_products.png)\nWhen the action is completed, a new order will be automatically added. It will be connected to the current visit and the account specified in the visit.\nTo add products to the order:\n1. A page with a list of products specified in the last order of the current account will open after running the **Order placement** action ([Fig. 2](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_69739_240)). Filter the required products from the catalog using quick filters. You can learn more about product selection in the \"[Find products in the catalog](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_35492)\" article.\nFig. 2 The order product page\n![Fig.\u00a02 The order product page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/scr_field_force_former_order.png)\n2. Click the ![btn_mobile_add_product.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/btn_mobile_add_product.png) button next to the needed product.\n3. In the displayed window, enter the number of ordered products and tap **Enter**. If necessary, repeat the action to add more products.  \nTo remove a product from the order, specify \"0\" as its quantity.\n4. Tap the **Proceed to order** link on the **Products in order** page that is located at the top left corner of the application window.\nAs a result, a new order with specified products will be added to the system.\n### Find products in the catalog\u200b\nIn the mobile app, you can search for products using the [product catalog](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=enterprise&ver=7&id=1226). The product folders that are used to search for products in the mobile app correspond to the product catalog that is configured in the **Products** section of the main application.\nnote\nThe product folders in the mobile app can be set up based on all base lookup fields of the **Products** section. In the mobile app, you cannot see the folders created based on the custom fields.\nFor example, the catalog is set up based on product categories and types. Display the products with the \"Bottled water\" category and the \"Soda\" type:\n1. Go to the **Products** detail in the mobile app.\n2. Click the **Products in order** link that is located in the title of the product list.\n3. In the displayed window, select the needed product category, for example, \"Bottled water\" ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_24510_165)).\nFig. 1 Selecting the product category\n![Fig.\u00a01 Selecting the product category](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/scr_field_force_mobile_select_product_category.png)\n4. From the list of tags that are connected to the selected category, select the needed product type, for example, \"Soda\" ([Fig. 2](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_93715_15)).\nFig. 2 Selecting the product type\n![Fig.\u00a02 Selecting the product type](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/scr_field_force_mobile_select_product_type.png)\nAs a result, the detail will display all products of the selected type that are available in Creatio.\nnote\nTo view the products that have been added to the order, select the **Products in order** folder.  \nYou can also display all products that are stored in Creatio. To do this, select the **All products** folder.  \nTo display all products of a certain category, select the **All in category...** folder from the menu of the corresponding category:\nTo perform a search by name, use the search string that is located at the top of the product list on the **Products** detail. Enter the needed value in the string. As a result, the detail will display all products whose name matches the search criteria ([Fig. 3](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_75535_167)).\nFig. 3 Searching for a product by name\n![Fig.\u00a03 Searching for a product by name](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/scr_field_force_mobile_search_line.png)\n### Copy products\u200b\nAlternatively, filter products using the list of products from the last order from the current sales outlet. When scheduling a visit, the **Products** detail is automatically filled in with the list of products specified during the previous visit to this sales outlet.\n## Monitor SKU\u200b\nDuring a visit, tap the **SKU Monitoring** action. A page will open, where you can enter the availability of products in stock and identify whether the products are on display ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_95083_13_SKU)).\nFig. 1 SKU monitoring page\n![Fig.\u00a01 SKU monitoring page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/ff_SKU_monitoring.png)\nYou can also use the smartphone or tablet camera to take a picture of products on display and attach it to the visit. To do this:\n1. On the section page, click **Edit**.\n2. Select the **Attachments** detail.\n3. Click ![btn_ff_add.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_visit_actions/btn_ff_add.png).\n4. Select the photo you made earlier and attach it to the activity. You can also use the **Take picture** action. The mobile device will switch to its camera mode. The picture taken will be automatically added to the **Attachments** detail.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Install the field sales app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1374)\n[Set up rules and actions of a visit](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1375)\n[Plan visits](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1380)\n[Check-in verification](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1799)",
