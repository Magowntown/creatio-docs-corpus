  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2Service tools\nOn this page\nCreatio enables you to calculate case response and resolution time. You can select the time calculation rule that suits you most and set it up according to your business specifics. Response and resolution deadlines can take the following factors into account:\n* case priority\n* case service\n* service in the applicable service agreement\nThe general procedure to set up response and resolution deadlines is as follows:\n* Set up calendars. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654#title-209-1)\n* Select a deadline calculation rule. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654#title-209-2)\n## Set up time values for deadline calculation rules\u200b\nThe response and resolution deadline calculation accounts for holidays, weekends and work hours specified in the calendar used for the customer service. Set up calendars for correct deadline calculation. By default, one standard calendar with the following characteristics is available:\n* Time zone GMT 0, without daylight saving time.\n* 5-day workweek (from Monday till Friday).\n* 8-hour work day (from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM), without lunch break.\n* Reduced work days and holidays are not included.\nThis calendar is specified as **default** in the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting. The system setting must be populated for the correct work of calendars. You can modify the standard calendar according to the support service schedule of your company, or create a new one and add it to the system setting as the default one. You can also create additional calendars that take into account additional scheduling of services provision. For example, calendars of services provision with different work hours or different time zones.\nThe **service calendar** is the calendar the system used to calculate case response and resolution deadlines. Creatio can use the following calendars, and they might vary for each strategy:\n### Set up service calendar\u200b\n1. **The calendar of the service in the applicable service agreement**. When service provision schedule differs from the general calendar of the service agreement, you can specify separate calendars on the service page in the service agreement. If the corresponding calendar is not specified, the system will use the calendar in the service contract.\n2. **The calendar of the applicable service agreement**. You can set up specific calendars of service provision for customers located in different time zone. This calendar is specified in the customer service agreement. One calendar can be specified in several service agreements. If the service contract calendar is not available, the system will use the base calendar.\n3. **The service calendar** is the service provision calendar specified in the \u201cService\u201d object. No-code creator can display the calendar field using Freedom UI Designer. If the calendar is not filled out, Creatio uses the base calendar.\n4. **Base calendar** is the calendar specified in the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting. The system uses this calendar if no custom calendar is specified.\nExample\nCreate a new calendar for a service that is provided six days a week. Saturday has shorter working hours. Fixed one-hour technical break.\n1. **Open the System Designer** by clicking the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/btn_system_designer_new.png) button.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 **open Lookups** section.\n3. **Open** the **Calendars** lookup.\n4. Click **New**. **Specify the new calendar name and time zone**.\n5. Click the ![btn_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_response_and_resolution_time_settings/btn_edit.png) button and **edit the workweek settings**. The default week parameters match the parameters of the base calendar.\n6. **Set up workweek**. Set the day type as \"Working day\" for all days from Monday to Friday, \"Reduced working\" for Saturday and \"Day off\" for Sunday.\n7. **Set up work time**. Set the technical break by separating the work time into two intervals, before and after the break: 9:00AM\u20131:00PM and 2:00PM\u20136:00PM.\n8. **Specify all holidays** on the **Days off** tab.\n**As a result** , the new calendar will be added. The created calendar can be set as the base calendar. Additionally, Creatio enables specifying this calendar in a service agreement page or the page of service in a service agreement.\nnote\nThe \"Working days\" time unit is not converted to working hours. If 1 working day is set as response deadline and the case was registered before the working day started, then the end of this working day will be the actual response deadline. If the case was registered during the working day, then the response deadline will be the end of the next working day. When Creatio recalculates deadlines, for example, after reopening a case, a full working day is deducted from the remaining time.\n### Specify the service calendar in the service agreement\u200b\n1. **Open the service agreement page**.\n2. **Click the name of the service** for which you want to specify a separate calendar. This opens a page.\n3. **Select the needed calendar** in the **Calendar** field.\n**As a result** , the new calendar will be used to calculate response and resolution deadlines for service in the service agreement.\n## Set up a case deadline calculation rule\u200b\nThe **Case deadline calculation schemas** lookup contains a list of [rules](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1653) that can be used for calculating response and resolution deadlines for cases.\nGeneral procedure for selecting a deadline calculation rule:\n* When calculating response and resolution time, the system will use the rule set by default.\n* If there is not enough data in the default schema, Creatio will use the alternative rule. If an alternative rule is not specified, the deadlines will not be calculated. If an alternative rule is specified, but also cannot be applied, its own alternative strategy will be used, and so on.\n* If none of the rules can be used, the deadlines will not be calculated.\nThe response time and resolution time are calculated independently from one another. If the data in the case is sufficient for calculation based on the base resolution time calculation rule, but not sufficient for calculation of the response time, then the resolution time will be calculated based on the base rule, and the response time - based on the alternative rule.\nExample\nSet up the calculation of deadlines by case priority with an alternative calculation by service.\n1. **Open the System Designer** by clicking the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/btn_system_designer_new.png) button.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 **open Lookups** section.\n3. **Open the**Case deadline calculation schemas** lookup content** (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 The Case deadline calculation schemas lookup\n![Fig.\u00a01 The Case deadline calculation schemas lookup](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/response_resolution_deadlines/scr_section_service_requests_dedline_calculation_rules_lookup.png)\n4. **Select** the \"By priority\" rule.\n5. **Select** the **Default** checkbox.\nThe **Default** checkbox can be selected only for one strategy. If you try to select a checkbox for two rules simultaneously, only the last selected checkbox will be saved.\n6. **Specify** \"By service\" in the **Alternative schema** field of the default rule.\nWe recommend setting up an alternative rule for each rule. Therefore, when calculating response and resolution time, all possible case parameters will be taken into account.\n## Set up case response and resolution deadlines\u200b\nThe response and resolution deadlines are calculated based on the case, service, and service contract data as well as the corresponding calendar. In Service Creatio, enterprise edition, the service agreement will also be taken into account.\nThe deadlines are calculated based on the following strategies:\n* by service\n* by priority\n* by service in SLA\nnote\nNew rules can be created using development tools in the Creatio platform.\n#### By service\u200b\nThis deadline calculation strategy is based on the service page data and the calendar of the service (Fig. 2) or the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting.\nFig. 2 Data used for calculating deadlines by service\n![Fig.\u00a02 Data used for calculating deadlines by service](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_by_service_rule.png)\n#### By priority\u200b\nCreatio uses the **Case priorities** lookup data (Fig. 3). This strategy is based on the response and resolution deadlines set for different case priorities. The calendar is taken from the service in service level agreement, service agreement, or \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting.\nFig. 3 Data used for calculating case deadlines by priority\n![Fig.\u00a03 Data used for calculating case deadlines by priority](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_by_priority_rule.png)\n#### By service in SLA\u200b\nThis strategy is based on the values in the **Response time** and **Resolution time** fields on the form page of **Available services in contract** list of the service agreement page (Fig. 4). Its alternative rule is \"By service\".\nFig. 4 Data used for calculating deadlines by service in SLA\n![Fig.\u00a04 Data used for calculating deadlines by service in SLA](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_by_service_in_sla_rule.png)\nnote\nIn this case, the specified calendar will be used when calculating the response and resolution time. Otherwise, the response time will be calculated according to the calendar in service agreement. If the service agreement contains no calendar, the time will be calculated according to the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Calculate response and resolution time](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1653)\n[Set up case statuses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1449)\n[Service agreement selection](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1553)",
