These licenses are linked to user accounts. When distributing personal licenses, make sure the number of provided licenses does not exceed the number of purchased licenses.

Enable access to all sections of the Creatio Marketing product. The number of licenses must correspond to the number of Creatio users.\n* **Active marketing contact** licenses (\"Creatio Marketing 1000 active contacts\"). Enable creating records in the **Email** , **Campaigns** , and **Events** sections. The number of licenses must be equal to or higher than the number of active contacts who receive marketing communications (emails, campaigns, or events).\nnote\nLicense names include prefixes that specify the Creatio deployment method: onsite or cloud. Cloud licenses do not apply to Creatio on-site and vice versa.\n**Active contacts** are contacts who have had at least 1 of the following types of marketing communications within the last year:\n* A contact was a part of an email audience and the email sent to the contact had a response from the user, for example, open or click.\n* A contact was a part of an event audience.\n* A contact was a part of a campaign audience.\n* A contact is a part of a loyalty program and they made at least 1 purchase within the last year (if you use Creatio Marketplace products that automate loyalty programs).\nLicenses are valid within the **licensing period**. The licensing period lasts for 365 days, starting from the license start date and ending on the date specified as \"Due date\" in the License Manager.\nThe contact can become active only once during a licensing period. If the contact was active during a previous licensing period, but they did not receive any marketing communications during the current period, Creatio does not consider the contact as active during the current period.\n**Make sure that the number of active contacts (used licenses) does not exceed the number of available licenses**.\nIf the number of used licenses exceeds that of the available licenses, errors might occur during the following:\n* saving or sending emails\n* editing email templates in the Content Designer\n* advancing a campaign to the **Marketing email** step\n* certain operations in the **Events** and **Campaigns** sections might be disabled\nCreatio notifies the users when the number of available active contact licenses becomes lower than the threshold percentage of the total number of paid licenses, 10% by default. Notifications are sent only to system users whose contacts are owners or creators of emails, campaigns, events over the past 30 days. We recommend such users to **check the**Notifications** tab** of the Communication panel regularly.\nnote\nYou can change the threshold percentage in the \"Active contacts - warning threshold (%)\" (\"ActiveContactsWarningThreshold\" code) system setting.\nIf the number of active contacts exceeds the number of purchased licenses, you need to purchase additional licenses. Send a license request to Creatio technical support team.\nThe following guidelines will help **avoid restrictions and errors caused by the lack of available licenses** :\n* When adding groups of contacts to email participants make sure to check the filters of corresponding contact folders. If the filters have been modified, participants who are not a part of the email target audience might be included in the folder. Creatio calculates the number of active contacts and available licenses regularly (once every 4 hours), and additionally each time after an email is sent. That is why the notification about insufficient licenses might be missing when you form the email audience.\n* If the number of active contacts does not exceed the available licenses at the moment of sending an email, Creatio sends emails to each of the recipients from the audience. For example, you have 10000 licenses and 9999 active contacts. You add 50000 recipients to the email audience. In this case, email messages are sent to all contacts from the audience. After sending the email, Creatio checks the license availability and applies licensing limitations if necessary.\n* When sending emails, be sure to check the settings that let you manage the sending operation and restrict sending emails to inactive contacts, namely:\n* Prohibition to use a contact\u2019s email address (the **Do not use Email** checkbox in the **Communication options** of the contact).\n* Ability to subscribe to certain email types as well as unsubscribe from them.\n#### Check the number of used active contact licenses\u200b\nThe number of owned licenses and active contacts is available in the **Dashboards** section, on the **Licenses** tab (Fig. 3). These metrics might slightly differ from the actual data since they are calculated once an hour. Since Creatio version 8.0.2 the indicators also display license end dates.\nYou can view the total number of marketing contact licenses and number of available licenses on tooltip on the list page and record page of the **Email** , **Campaigns** , **Events** sections as well. The tooltip color depends on the number of available licenses and varies from green (sufficient licenses) to red (no vacant licenses). These numbers might slightly differ from the actual data since they are calculated once an hour.\nFig. 4 License indicator\n![Fig.\u00a04 License indicator](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_8_0_2/scr_marketing_active_licenses.png)\nCreatio checks license availability on schedule or after sending an email. We recommend checking the number of available licenses manually when you prepare a new email communication with customers.\nTo view the list of active contacts, set up a filter in the **Contacts** section as shown in Fig. 5.\nImportant\nThe filter does not include the loyalty program participants.\nFig. 5 Filter that displays active marketing contacts\n![Fig.\u00a05 Filter that displays active marketing contacts](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Setup_and_Administration/creatio_licensing/8_1/chapter_licensing_active_contacts_filter.png)\nThe \"Created on\" date in the filter is the date when the licenses were uploaded to Creatio. To calculate the needed date:\nFig. 6 View the license validity term\n![Fig.\u00a06 View the license validity term](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/licensing/scr_chapter_licensing_term_of_validity.png)\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/academy_en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/creatio_licensing/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) to open the System Designer.\n2. Go to the \"Users and administration\" block \u2192 \"**License manager**.\" This opens a page.\n3. Use the search field to find the needed license by name quickly and view its end date on the page that opens (Fig. 6).\n4. Copy the start date of the license.\nAs a result, you will get the start date of the license validity period. Enter the date in the **Created on** column when setting up the filter that selects active contacts.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1472)",
