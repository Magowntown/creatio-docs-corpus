Incoming signal for creating a lead through a landing page - when you create a lead through a landing page, the signal is activated and the business process is started.\n2. Reading the created lead data - obtaining lead parameters that will be later used in the business process.\nnote\nConfigure a separate business process to set up automatic assigning of the lead owner.\n3. Sending an email - sending an email with the specified text and the lead data obtained in the previous step of the business process.\nFig. 1 The Sending email when creating lead via landing page business process\n![Fig. 1 The Sending email when creating lead via landing page business process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_designer_case_lead.png)\nTo do this:\n1. Place the **Signal** element on the diagram. The element is located in the **Initial events** group \u2014 \"Lead created\" . The element will be activated when a lead is created registered via a landing page.\n2. Set up the signal parameters (Fig. 2).\n1. In the **Object** field, set \"Lead\".\n2. In the **What event should happen?** field, select \"Add record\".\n3. In the **Added record must correspond to conditions** field, select \"Add record\".\nFig. 2 Setting up the signal properties\n![Fig. 2 Setting up the signal properties](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_designer_case_lead_starting_signal_settings.png)\n3. Add the **Read data** element of the **System actions** group and name it \"Read lead\". The \"Read lead\" element will read data from the added lead.\n4. Set up the element parameters (Fig. 3).\n1. In the **Which data read mode to use?** field, select \"Read the first record in the selection.\"\n2. In the **Which object to read data from?** field, select \"Lead.\"\n3. In the **How to filter records?** area, set the filter \"Id = Lead created.Record ID\". To do this, click `<Add condition>`, select the \"Id\" column, in the displayed menu select the **Compare with parameter** , and then in the appeared window select **Unique record ID** of the \"Lead created\" element.\nFig. 3 The Read lead element setup area\n![Fig. 3 The Read lead element setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_designer_case_lead_read_leaddata.png)\n5. Add the \"Send e-mail\" element and set the following parameters (Fig. 4):\n1. Specify the necessary email account in the **From** field. To do this, select **Select from lookup** in the parameter value menu, then in the **Synchronization with mailbox settings** lookup, select one of the configured email accounts.\n2. In the **To** field, specify the email of the recipient. To do this, select **Process Parameter** in the value window of the **Contact** menu item. Select the \"Read lead\" element in the pop up window and select \"Owner\" in the **Process parameter** field.\n3. In the **What is the message?** field select \"Template message.\"\n4. Select the existing template in the **Template message** field. The **Subject** field is populated automatically.\n5. Select \"Send email automatically\" in the **How is the message sent?** field.\nFig. 4 Send email element properties area\n![Fig.\u00a04 Send email element properties area](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_designer_case_lead_send_email.png)\n6. After creating the process elements, connect each element with the next one by dragging the ![icn_process_elements_connection_straight.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/icn_process_elements_connection_straight.png) element in the upper right corner of the selected process element.\n7. Save the created business process.\nAs a result of the business process, upon receiving a lead via a landing page, an email is sent to the responsible employee.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Send emails via business processes](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7066)",
