  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nnote\nThis functionality is available for Creatio 8.1.3 and later.\n`Terrasoft.Configuration.CrtUIv2` namespace.\nThe `Terrasoft.Configuration.CrtUIv2.ILicenseRedistributionService` class provides programmatic, server-side control over license redistribution. Use this class to redistribute licenses as part of advanced automation and integration scenarios, for example when you need to:\n* Automate role-based license redistribution for new and existing users.\n* Apply complex or conditional business rules.\n* Process large user groups efficiently.\n* Integrate license redistribution with external systems or custom components.\nThe class uses the same license redistribution logic as manual redistribution and business process-based redistribution. Learn more: [Automate role-based license redistribution](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15388).\nBefore using the `LicenseRedistributionService` class in custom business logic, retrieve a class instance through dependency injection using the `ILicenseRedistributionService` interface as follows.\nvar licenseService = ClassFactory.Get<ILicenseRedistributionService>();  \n## Methods\u200b\nRedistributeLicences(  \nbool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences  \n)  \nRedistribute licenses for all active users.\nParameters\nbool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences| Whether to recalculate manually granted licenses. By default, \"false.\"Available values| true| All licenses are recalculated, including overriding manually granted licenses based on role priority. Use when a full license recalculation is required.  \n---|---  \nfalse| Manually granted licenses remain unchanged. Recommended for most scenarios to preserve administrator adjustments.  \n* * *\nRedistributeLicencesForRole(  \nbool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences,  \nGuid roleId  \n)  \nRedistribute licenses for a specific user role.\nParameters\nbool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences| Whether to recalculate manually granted licenses. By default, \"false.\"Available values| true| All licenses are recalculated, including overriding manually granted licenses based on role priority. Use this value when a full license recalculation is required for the role.  \n---|---  \nfalse| Manually granted licenses remain unchanged. Recommended for most scenarios to keep administrator adjustments unchanged.  \nGuid roleId| ID of the user role whose licenses are redistributed.  \n* * *\nRedistributeLicencesForUser(  \nGuid userId,  \nbool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences,  \nbool hasManuallyAssignedLicense  \n)  \nRedistribute licenses for a single user.\nParameters\nGuid userId| ID of the user whose licenses are recalculated.  \n---|---  \nbool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences| Whether to recalculate manually granted licenses. By default, \"false.\"Available values| true| All licenses are recalculated, including overriding manually granted licenses based on role priority. Use this value when a full license recalculation is required for the user.  \n---|---  \nfalse| Manually granted licenses remain unchanged. Recommended for most scenarios to keep administrator adjustments unchanged.  \nbool hasManuallyAssignedLicense| Whether the user has manually granted licenses before redistribution. Creatio uses this parameter to determine how to apply license rules during redistribution.Available values| true| The user has manually granted licenses in addition to role-based licenses.  \n---|---  \nfalse| The user has only role-based licenses.  \n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Automate role-based license redistribution](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15388)",
