  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2Service Creatio\nOn this page\n### Why does the list not display all cases even when you scroll all the way down?\u200b\nBy default, the list displays only cases that have \"New,\" \"In progress,\" \"Pending,\" \"Resolved,\" or \"Reopened\" statuses. To view closed and canceled cases, select the **Show closed cases** checkbox.\n### Why was the case not created from an incoming email?\u200b\nThis issue can have multiple reasons:\n* **Support mailbox is misconfigured**. Ensure that the mailbox synchronization is configured, mailbox owner is an active user, the owner has **Service** license, and the mailbox is added to the **List of mailboxes for case registration** lookup. Learn more: [Set up automatic case registration from email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1063).\n* **That was a junk email**. Ensure that the email was not sent from the domains added to the **Blacklist of email addresses and domains for case registration** lookup. Learn more: [Skip case registration for junk mail](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1788)\n* **Email is linked to an existing case**. Learn more: [Create a case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1613#title-201-6).\n### Why was the case reopened?\u200b\nCreatio reopens paused cases and cases that have the \"Waiting for response,\" \"Resolved\" status automatically if an incoming email that contains the case number in its subject is received. You can also reopen a case manually by selecting the \"Reopened\" status on the progress bar (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Reopen a case manually\n![Fig. 1 Reopen a case manually](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/faq/scr_reopen_a_case_manually.png)\n### Why can I not attach an email or publish a message for a case in a final stage?\u200b\nA case in a final stage is a case that was processed fully. This case cannot be re-opened or resolved again. Incoming emails cannot be attached to this case. If at any point a user asks an additional question about a closed or canceled case, register a new case and specify the closed case as its parent case.\nCase feed is accessible for the support team regardless of case status. Service team member can connect any incoming and outgoing message to the case in the final stage manually or send the email from the case page.\n### In what cases and why does Creatio send automatic notifications to contacts?\u200b\nBy default, automatic notifications are sent to case contacts if the case status is changed. Learn more: [Set up email notifications.](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1787)\nAutomatic notifications are not sent when:\n* the case contact profile does not contain an email address\n* the mailbox for automatic notifications is not set up\n### What happens to a case that was not evaluated?\u200b\nIf customers do not assess the support service quality after receiving an email about case resolution, they receive an additional evaluation request in a few days. If no evaluation is received after the additional request, the case is closed automatically. You can change the waiting time for the evaluation response in the \"Number of waiting days to reevaluate resolved case\" (\"FirstReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) and \"Number of waiting days after second reminder of resolved case\" (\"SecondReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) system settings.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1613)\n[Set up response and resolution deadlines](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654)",
