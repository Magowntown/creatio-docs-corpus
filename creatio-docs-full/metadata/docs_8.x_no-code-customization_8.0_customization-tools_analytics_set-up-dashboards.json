This dashboard tile is available in Creatio products that include the **Opportunities** section. Read more >>>\nnote\nIf your company employees use different Creatio localizations (\"cultures\"), you need to set up the dashboards and tiles in the base culture to let everyone access them. Dashboards configured in a different localization will not be available for users working with another culture.\n## Set up chart\u200b\nThe \"Chart\" dashboard tile displays Creatio dynamics and percentages. For example, you can use a chart to display the distribution of events by types (Fig. 1).\nLearn more: [Analyze chart](https://academy.creatio.com/node/185#title-185-1).\nFig. 1 Chart example\n![Fig.\u00a01 Chart example](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_chart.png)\n### Chart setup procedure\u200b\nYou can customize the chart's parameters on the setup page. (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Chart setup page\n![Fig.\u00a02 Chart setup page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_analytics_add_analytics_to_page_chart_setup_example.png)\n1. Fill out the fields at the top of the page:\n1. **Title** \u2013 the chart name that will be displayed on the dashboard tile. This is a required field.\n2. **X-axis label** and **Y-axis label** \u2013 the labels of X and Y axes on the chart. These fields are only displayed for charts with axes (\"Spline,\" \"Line,\" \"Area chart,\" and \"Scatter chart\").\n2. Fill out the fields in the **What to display** field group:\n1. **Object** \u2013 a Creatio object (a section, a detail, or a lookup) to be used as a data source. For example, select the \"Activity\" object to calculate the average call duration (calls are activities of the \"Call\" category). This is a required field.\n2. **Function** \u2013 how the chart will process the source data. This is a required field. You can choose among the following options:\n* \"count\" \u2013 use this option to generate a chart by the number of Creatio object's records. For example, you can check the number of activities by type.\n* \"maximum,\" \"minimum,\" and \"average\" \u2013 use these options the check the corresponding values of the data source's numeric column or a date column. For example, you can calculate the average employee activity duration.\n* \"sum\" \u2013 use this option to display the sum of values in a numeric column. For instance, you can calculate the duration of employee's activities within a week.\n3. **Column** \u2013 a column the function will use for the calculations. You can specify a numeric or a date column. For example, specify the \"Duration (minutes)\" column to calculate the average call duration by manager (Fig. 3). This field will not display if you select \"count\" in the **Function** field. This is a required field for all the other options.\nFig. 3 Setting up chart's What to display field group\n![Fig.\u00a03 Setting up chart's What to display field group](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_what_to_show_graph.png)\n4. **Chart type** \u2013 the chart's structure, for example, \"Bar chart\" or \"Pie chart.\" This is a required field.\n5. **With stacked** \u2013 select this checkbox to display the chart as a stacked area chart. These kinds of charts display each column/bar as a total sum of separate data categories. The size of each column is proportionate to the value of the corresponding data element. Stacked area charts are useful if you need to compare not only the separate data values but also the total sums. For example, the chart can simultaneously display the total sum of opportunity amounts on each stage by different employees or the contribution of each stage to the total sum.\nThe **With stacked** checkbox displays for the \"Column\" and \"Bar\" chart types. If you set up a chart with several series, they will share the same **With stacked** value. For instance, if you select this checkbox for one of the series, the chart will automatically select it for all the other series with the \"Column\" or \"Bar\" chart types. Similarly, if you deselect it in one of the series, the chart will automatically deselect them for all the other series.\n6. **Show legend** \u2013 select the checkbox to display the chart's legend. The legend displays the chart color and the text from the **Index number caption** field at the bottom of the chart setup page. If the Index number caption field is empty, the legend displays the name of the object used as a data source.\nThe Show legend checkbox displays for the following chart types: \"Spline,\" \"Line,\" \"Bar,\" \"Area,\" \"Column,\" or \"Scatter.\"\n3. Fill out the fields in the **How to group** field group.\n1. **Column** \u2013 the column by which the chart values are grouped. Every value of this column will be a separate chart element: bar, sector, etc. This is a required field. For instance, to calculate the number of new activities within a specific time period, set the field to \"Created on.\" You can group data by any column of the chart's object.\n2. **Format** \u2013 the date format the chart will use, for example, \"Week\" or \"Month & year.\" This field is displayed if you select a date column in the **Column** field of the How to group block. For example, to review the number of new activities by month, specify \"Month & year\" in the **Format** field and \"Created on\" in the **Column** field (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Setting up chart's How to group field group\n![Fig.\u00a04 Setting up chart's How to group field group](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_group_graph.png)\n3. **Use empty value** \u2013 if you select this checkbox, the chart will include the records with an empty grouping column (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Opportunities by category chart that includes empty values\n![Fig.\u00a05 Opportunities by category chart that includes empty values](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_show_empty_values.png)\n4. Fill out the fields in the **How to sort** field group:\n1. **Sort by** \u2013 the value by which the chart elements are sorted. For instance, the \"Activities by owner\" chart groups the values by the Owner field. Each chart block in this chart represents a number of activities. Select \"By grouping field\" to sort the chart elements alphabetically (in this case by the Owner field) or select \"By selection result\" to sort them by the number of activities.\n2. **Sorting order** \u2013 determines the display order of the chart values. For instance, select \"Ascending\" to display the values in alphabetical order (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Setting up chart's How to sort field group\n![Fig.\u00a06 Setting up chart's How to sort field group](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_sort_graph.png)\n5. Specify the data filtering conditions in the **How to filter** field group.\nFor example, set the time frame in the filter conditions, such as \"Created on = Current month,\" to create a chart that shows how many contacts were added within a specific time period (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 Setting up chart's How to filter field group\n![Fig.\u00a07 Setting up chart's How to filter field group](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_filter_graph.png)\nThe filter becomes available once you fill out the **Object** field.\nnote\nLearn more about the advanced filter in the [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/node/1755#title-1755-10) article.\n6. Fill out the fields in the **How to associate with section data** field group:\n**Connect ... object with ... section by field** \u2013 fill out the field if you need to apply the filters set in the section itself to the chart data. If you leave this field empty, the chart will ignore the section filters. The field is populated automatically if you use the object of the dashboard's record page as the chart's data source. The field becomes available after you fill out the **Object** field. It does not display when setting up charts in the **Dashboards** section.\nLet's take a more in-depth look at the several possible relations between the chart and the section records:\n* The chart uses the current section's records (the chart object matches the section object). For example, you create a chart in the **Activities** section and select \"Activity\" in the Object field. In this case, the connection field is automatically populated with the **Id** column.\nIf you select the **Id** in the field (Fig. 8), the chart will use the records that correspond to the section's filter conditions. For example, if you apply a filter by completed activities, the chart will only display the data for the completed activities.\nFig. 8 Connecting chart to section by Id field\n![Fig.\u00a08 Connecting chart to section by Id field](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_associate_same_section.png)\nIf you clear the connection field, the chart will display the data for all section records regardless of the section's filter conditions.\n* The chart uses records from a different section (the chart object is different from the section object). For example, you created an \"Activities by owner\" chart in the **Contacts** section to display the number of activities by different owners. In this case the connection field lets you select among several chart object columns that are connected to the current section's object.\nIf you fill out the **Connect...** field, the chart will only use the records that match the filter conditions specified in the current section. For instance, you can select the \"Owner\" column for the \"Activities by owner\" chart (Fig. 9). If you set a filter for the **Contacts** section, the chart will only display the data for the activities where the owner matches that filter.\nFig. 9 Connecting chart to section by Owner field\n![Fig.\u00a09 Connecting chart to section by Owner field](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_associate_other_section.png)\nIf you leave the connection field empty, the chart will display the data for all section records regardless of the current section's filter conditions.\nIf the chart's data is not connected to the section's data, leave the **Connect...** field empty. For example, create an \"Activities by owner\" chart in the **Knowledge base** section.\n7. Fill out the fields in the **How to display** field group:\n1. **Format** \u2013 changes the number of digits after the decimal point for numeric values. The setup is done in a pop-up window. Click ![btn_com_lookup.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/btn_com_lookup.png) to open it. For example, set this field's value to \"1\" to display a number with a single digit after the decimal point. To only display the whole part of the number, set the value to \"0.\" If the chart has more than one series, you can set a different value for each one.\n2. **Style** \u2013 changes the color of the dashboard tile header and the chart elements.\n3. **X-Axis label** , **Y-Axis label** \u2013 these fields set the X and Y axes' labels for each chart series. They only appear for chart types that contain axes (\"Spline,\" \"Line,\" \"Area chart,\" and \"Scatter chart\") (Fig. 10).\n4. **Index number caption** \u2013 sets the text at the top of the dashboard for each chart series.\nThis field displays for the following chart types: \"Column,\" \"Bar,\" \"Pie,\" and \"Pipeline.\"\nFig. 10 Setting up How to display field group for Spline, Line, Area chart, and Scatter chart chart types\n![Fig.\u00a010 Setting up How to display field group for Spline, Line, Area chart, and Scatter chart chart types](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_show_graph.png)\nnote\nThe values of the **X-axis label** and **Y-axis label** fields at the top of the chart setup page override the values of **X-Axis label of series** and **Y-Axis label of series** fields in the **How to display** field group at the bottom of the page.\n### Display several series on chart\u200b\nYou can display several sets of data called \"series\" on your chart. For example, you can display employee meetings and calls on separate series (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Example of chart with two series\n![Fig.\u00a011 Example of chart with two series](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_multi_series.png)\nTo **add a series** to a chart:\n1. Select **Add series** in the ![btn_com_menu_gear.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/btn_com_menu_gear.png) button's menu on the chart setup page.\n2. Fill out the required fields on the new series' tab.\n3. Save the chart setup page and the dashboard setup page.\nThis will make the chart display the new data series.\nIf you select a chart type that is incompatible with the other series, Creatio will display a warning and use the chart type that was selected first. For example, the warning will appear if you select a \"Line\" chart for the first series and a \"Bar\" chart for the second series. Both charts will be displayed as a \"Line\" chart (Fig. 12).\nIf you select the **With stacked** checkbox in one of the series with \"Column\" or \"Bar\" chart type, the checkbox will also be applied to all other series of the \"Column\" or \"Bar\" chart type. In that case the chart will display as a stacked column chart or a stacked bar chart.\nFig. 12 Chart compatibility\n![Fig.\u00a012 Chart compatibility](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_compatibility_chartJS.png)\nTo **copy a series** and create a new series with similar settings:\n1. Navigate to the tab of the series you would like to copy.\n2. Select **Copy series** in the ![btn_com_menu_gear00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/btn_com_menu_gear00001.png) button menu on the chart setup page.\n3. Save the chart setup page and the dashboard setup page.\nThis will make the chart setup page display a copy of the old series. You can edit the new series however you need, e. g. change the column the function will use, modify the data display period, etc.\nTo **delete a series** :\n1. Navigate to the tab of the series you would like to delete.\n2. Select **Delete series** in the ![btn_com_menu_gear00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/btn_com_menu_gear00002.png) button menu on the chart setup page.\n3. Save the chart setup page and the dashboard setup page.\n## Set up metric\u200b\nThe \"Metric\" dashboard tile (Fig. 13) displays a calculated numeric value or a date based on Creatio data, for example, the number of employees in the department.\nFig. 13 Metric example\n![Fig.\u00a013 Metric example](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_indicator.png)\nMetrics can display the following data types:\n* The total number of records in an object, filtered or unfiltered. For example, the number of all employee contacts in Creatio.\n* The minimum or maximum value of a numeric field or a date field. For example, the minimum or maximum call duration.\n* The sum or the average value of a numeric field, for example, the sum of invoice payments.\n### Metric setup procedure\u200b\nYou can customize the metric's parameters on the setup page.\n1. Fill out the **Title** field with the desired title.\n2. Fill out the fields in the **What to display** field group:\nFig. 14 Setting up the metric's What to display field group\n![Fig.\u00a014 Setting up the metric's What to display field group](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_what_to_show_indicator.png)\n1. **Object** \u2013 Creatio object to be used as a data source This is a required field.\n2. **Function** \u2013 how the metric will process the source data. This is a required field. You can choose among the following options:\n* \"count\" \u2013 the number of object records. For example, total number of employee records in Creatio.\n* \"sum\" \u2013 the sum of a data column's values. For example, the total duration of employees' calls.\n* \"average,\" \"minimum,\" \"maximum\" \u2013 the corresponding values of a data column. For example, the average duration of employees' calls. The \"average\" function is not available for all columns.\n3. **Column** \u2013 the column the function will use for calculations. This is a required field. You can specify a numeric or a date column. For instance, select the \"Duration (minutes)\" column to calculate your employees' average call duration. This field will not display if you select \"count\" in the **Function** field.\n3. Specify the filtering conditions in the **How to filter** field group:\nFor example, you can display your employees' average call duration during the previous month by setting the conditions to: \"Created on = Previous month\" (Fig. 15).\nFig. 15 Setting up metric's How to filter field group\n![Fig.\u00a015 Setting up metric's How to filter field group](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_dashboards_how_to_filter_indicator.png)\nThe filter becomes available once you fill out the **Object** field.\nnote\nLearn more about the advanced filter in the [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/node/1755#title-1755-10) article.\n4. Fill out the fields in the **How to associate with section data** field group:\n**Connect ... object with ... section by field** \u2013 fill out the field if you need to apply the filters set in the section itself to the metric data. The metric will not use the section filters if you leave this field empty. The field is not available when setting up metrics in the **Dashboards** section until you fill out the **Object** field.\nRead more about possible relations between the data source and the section's object in the chart setup section.\n5. Fill out the fields in the **How to display** field group:\n1. **Style** \u2013 the color of the title and the value\n2. **Font size** \u2013 the metric's text size. You can select between \"Default\" and \"Large.\"\n3. **Format** \u2013 changes the number of digits after the decimal point for numeric values. Perform the setup in a pop-up window (Fig. 16). Click ![btn_com_lookup00003.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/btn_com_lookup00003.png) to open it.\n6. Specify the text to accompany the metric's value in the pop-up's **Text** field. For example, if the metric should read \"Total employees: 513\" where 513 is the actual data, enter the following: \"Total employees: 0.\" If the metric should read \"513 employees,\" enter the following: \"0 employees.\"\nnote\nIf you enter the variable incorrectly, the metric will not display the numeric value. To restore the variable, clear the field and click Yes in the pop-up.\n7. Specify how many digits after the decimal point the metric should display in the **Number of digits after decimal points** field. Set the value to \"0\" to display only the integer part of the number.\n## Set up gauge\u200b\nThe \"Gauge\" dashboard tile (Fig. 17) displays a value based on Creatio data relative to a custom scale.\nLearn more: [Analyze gauge](https://academy.creatio.com/node/185#title-185-5).\nFig. 17 Gauge dashboard tile\n![Fig.\u00a017 Gauge dashboard tile](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/scr_analytics_speedometer.png)\n### Gauge setup procedure\u200b\nYou can customize the gauge's parameters on the setup page. Setting up the \"Gauge\" dashboard tile is similar to setting up the \"Metric\" dashboard tile, but you also need to set up a scale to put the data into context. To do this:\n1. Open the **How to display** field group on the gauge setup page.\n2. Specify the gauge title color in the **Style** field.\n3.

In this case, these are the following columns: **Type** , **Owner** , **Account** , **Budget** (Fig. 23).\nFig. 23 Setting up list columns\n![Fig.\u00a023 Setting up list columns](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_set_list_for_pivot_table.png)\n2. Navigate to the **Pivot table settings** tab and drag all the relevant columns from the **All dimensions** block to the corresponding blocks of the pivot table (Fig. 24).\nTo move a column to a different block, drag&drop it with the mouse pointer. You can also delete a column by clicking ![specs_dashboards_pivot_table_btn_delete.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_pivot_table_btn_delete.png) and draging from the **All dimensions** block to the correct block once again.\nFig. 24 Setting up pivot table\n![Fig.\u00a024 Setting up pivot table](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_set_pivot_table.gif)\n3. The **Group rows** block lets you group data in the table rows. The higher is the column in the block, the higher the grouping level. To change the grouping level, drag&drop the column to the relevant position. In this case you need to move the **Type** and **Owner** columns to this block.\nnote\nYou can set up a pivot table with an unlimited number of rows, however, Creatio can only display up to 10 000 rows at a time. Try restructuring the table to display all of the rows. For example, you can delete the less important level of detail.\n4. The **Group columns** block lets you group data in the table columns. The higher is the column in the block, the higher the grouping level. To change the grouping level, drag&drop the column to the relevant position. In this case you need to move the **Account** column to this block.\nnote\nThe pivot table can display up to 250 columns at a time. If there are more columns in your table, change the display format to include fewer levels of detail or set filter conditions.\n5. The **Measures** block provides various functions to calculate the values by column. For instance, you can count the number of populated fields or sum up their values. By default, Creatio calculates the sum of values for numeric columns and counts populated fields for other column types.\nTo change the calculation function, click ![specs_dashboards_pivot_table_btn_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_pivot_table_btn_edit.png) on the relevant column This will open a pop-up window (Fig. 25). Select the function you need there and click **Save** to apply it. In this case you need to drag the **Budget** column to this block and set its calculation function to \"Amount.\"\nFig. 25 Setting up calculation function\n![Fig.\u00a025 Setting up calculation function](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboardst_set_field.png)\n6. Click **Save** to apply the settings.\nThis will add a pivot table to your dashboard. You can change the grouping of rows, columns and values if necessary. To do this, drag&drop the columns to the relevant blocks with the mouse. Creatio will restructure the table automatically.\nnote\nClick ![specs_dashboards_pivot_table_btn_delete.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_pivot_table_btn_delete.png) to display a \"List\" tile instead of a pivot table, remove the columns from the **Group rows** , **Group columns** and **Measures** blocks on the **Pivot table settings** tab.\n### Set up formula calculations\u200b\nThe pivot tables support calculated fields: columns that use formulas for automatic calculation. For example, this field can calculate a salesperson's bonus money based on the contract amount or the no tax product price. Learn more: [Formulas in business logic and pivot tables](https://academy.creatio.com/node/1969/).\nExample\nYou need to calculate a salesperson's bonus per account. The bonus is 10% of the opportunity amount.\nTo do this:\n1. Follow **steps 1\u20133** from the Pivot table setup procedure block to set up a pivot table by owners and accounts.\n2. Click **Add calculated field** (Fig. 26) to add a calculated field that will calculate the bonus.\nThis will open the formula setup window. The formula can use numerical constants, the table's numerical fields (parameters) and mathematical operators.\nFig. 26 Adding calculated field\n![Fig.\u00a026 Adding calculated field](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_up_dashboards/set_dashboards_pivot_table_add_calculate_field_0.png)\n3. You can use any numerical parameter from the pivot table in the formula setup window. For example, select the \"Opportunity amount\" parameter.\n4. Use the mathematical operator panel and the keyboard to create a bonus-calculating formula (Fig. 27).\nFig. 27 Setting up formula for calculated field\n![Fig.\u00a027 Setting up formula for calculated field](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_up_dashboards/set_dashboards_pivot_table_add_calculate_field.png)\n5. Click **Save**. This will add a new column to the **All dimensions** block.\n6. Drag&drop the column to the **Measures** block.\nThis will add the calculated field to the pivot table.\nKeep in mind that formulas have the following **limitations** :\n* You cannot add a formula with only a single column, i. e. with only a numerical parameter.\n* You cannot only use a fractional number as a numerical constant. Add mathematical operations or numerical parameters.\n* The numbers in the formula can contain up to 13 digits.\nLearn more about working with formulas in the [Formulas in business logic and pivot tables](https://academy.creatio.com/node/1969/) article. \n## Set up widget\u200b\nThe \"Widget\" dashboard tile displays custom data visualization modules. For example, currency exchange rate widgets. Use these modules to display pivot information and analyze your Creatio sections' static data.\nYou can specify the following on the widget setup page (Fig. 28):\n* **Module** \u2013 the custom data visualization module the tile will use.\n* **Module parameters** \u2013 the parameters for further visual customization.\nFig. 28 Widget setup page\n![Fig.\u00a028 Widget setup page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_widget_setup_page.png)\nWidgets are added and set up by developers. Learn more: [Dashboard widgets](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15605) (developer documentation).\n## Set up full pipeline\u200b\nThe \"Full pipeline\" dashboard tile displays the complete sales life cycle by stage, from lead registration to the closed opportunity (Fig. 29).\nLearn more: [Analyze pipeline](https://academy.creatio.com/node/185#title-185-7).\nFig. 29 Full pipeline dashboard tile\n![Fig.\u00a029 Full pipeline dashboard tile](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/chapter_analytics_lead_sales_pipeline.png)\n### Full pipeline setup procedure\u200b\nYou can customize the full pipeline's parameters on the setup page.\n1. Fill out the **Title** field with the desired title.\n2. Specify the filtering conditions in the **How to filter leads?** field group:\nFor example, you can display the conversion dynamics only for leads registered on a specific landing page or for leads with a specific customer need.\n3. Specify the filtering conditions in the **How to filter opportunities?** field group:\nFor instance, you can display the conversion dynamics only for leads handed off to sales and with orders.\n## Set up sales pipeline\u200b\nThe \"Sales pipeline\" dashboard tile displays the opportunity dynamics by stage (Fig. 30).\nFig. 30 Sales pipeline dashboard tile\n![Fig.\u00a030 Sales pipeline dashboard tile](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_sales_pipeline.png)\n### Sales pipeline setup procedure\u200b\nYou can customize the full pipeline's parameters on the setup page (Fig. 31).\nFig. 31 Sales pipeline setup page\n![Fig.\u00a031 Sales pipeline setup page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/analytics/BPMonlineHelp/analytics_settings/specs_dashboards_sales_pipeline_setup_page.png)\n1. Fill out the **Title** field with the desired title. This is a required field.\n2. Specify the filtering conditions in the **How to filter** field group:\nFor example, you can display the dynamics of a particular owner's opportunities. The sales pipeline does not include opportunities with the following statuses: **Closed lost** , **Closed rejected** and **Closed rerouted**.\n3. Fill out the fields in the **How to associate with section data** field group:\n**Connect ... object with ... section by field** \u2013 fill out the field if you need to apply the filters set in the section itself to the chart data.\nnote\nCreatio generates a sales pipeline based on the Opportunity object's **stage** field.\nIf you leave this field empty, the sales pipelines will ignore the section filters.\nThis field is not available when setting up sales pipelines in the **Dashboards** section.\n4. Fill out the fields in the **How to display** field group:\n**Period by default** \u2013 the filtering period to be used in the pipeline's quick filter by default. For instance, \"Current month.\"\nnote\nLearn more about the quick filter in the [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/node/1755#title-1755-1) article.\n## Set up web page\u200b\nThe \"Web page\" dashboard tile displays web pages on the dashboard. For example, you can display a search engine page, an online currency converter or your corporate web site.\n### Web page setup procedure\u200b\nUse the Web page designer to customize the tile. You can open the designer after adding a new \"Web page\" tile to the dashboard page or by editing an existing tile.\nTo set up the tile:\n1. Specify the dashboard tile's title in the **Title** field.\n2. Fill out the **Page URL** field with the relevant web page's URL. The link must include the data transfer protocol type (\"HTTP,\" \"HTTPS\").\nIf your Creatio application is served over the secure data transfer protocol (\"HTTPS\"), the link must contain the HTTPS scheme as well. Pages served over HTTP will not display on Creatio sites served over HTTPS.\nIf your Creatio application is served over HTTP, you can add pages served over both HTTP and HTTPS.\nnote\nTo add a YouTube video to the dashboard, use the link specified in the **Embed** tab that opens when you click the Share button on the video's page.\n3. You can add CSS code to the **Styles** field to customize the dashboard tile border's width or color. Keep in mind that this field only supports CSS, HTML styles will not work. For instance, if you add the following code: `border-width: medium; border-color: red; border-style: solid`, \u2013 the border will have an average width and it will be colored red.\nnote\nIf you cannot see the web page on the dashboard after setting the tile up, the site owner may have disallowed to display that page in third-party iframes. Some sites enable these restrictions as a part of their security policy. You can check for these restrictions in the browser console. You can open it by pressing F12 in most browsers. The display in third-party iframes is restricted if the console displays the following errors: X-Frame-Options: DENY or X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Add analytics to a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1837)\n[View analytics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1236)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Analytics in Creatio.
