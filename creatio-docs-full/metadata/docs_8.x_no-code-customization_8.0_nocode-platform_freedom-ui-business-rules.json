  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nBusiness rules control the page UI behavior and business logic. You can specify conditions and actions to take when those conditions are met. This lets you customize page behavior to better suit your needs, streamline data entry, enforce data standards, and improve data quality.\nTo access business rule configuration on an app page:\n1. **Click** ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/move_a_classic_ui_section_to_freedom_ui/btn_system_designer.png) in the top right \u2192 **Application Hub**.\n2. **Open the needed app** or [create a custom app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2377).\n3. **Open the page** or create a custom page.\n4. **Click** the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_open_business_rules_designer.png) button in the top right (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Open the business rules setup page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Open the business rules setup page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_open_business_rules.png)\n## View the list of business rules\u200b\nYou can set up business rules on the page or object level. After you set up a **page-level rule** , Creatio applies it to the elements only on the selected page. After you set up an **object-level rule** , Creatio applies it to every Freedom UI page that uses the corresponding object, including editable lists. You can set up multiple business rules for a page or object. The list of business rules is displayed on the business rules setup page (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 List of business rules\n![Fig.\u00a02 List of business rules](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_business_rules_list.png)\nImportant\nIf multiple rules affect the same page element, only the first rule is activated.\n* Click **Add rule** to **create a new business rule**.\n* Select a rule in the list and click its name to **view or edit the rule**.\n* Select a rule in the list and click the **Enabled** toggle in the setup area to **turn the rule on or off** (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Turn on the rule\n![Fig.\u00a03 Turn on the rule](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_turn_on_rule.png)\n* Select a rule in the list and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_dots_menu_blue.png) \u2192 **Copy** to **copy the rule**.\n* Select a rule in the list and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_dots_menu_blue.png) \u2192 **Delete** to **delete the rule**.\n## Show/hide an element on a Freedom UI page\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that makes certain elements on record pages visible or hidden under specific conditions.\nExample\nShow the **Sick leave, days left** field on a request page for requests whose **Originator type** attribute is an employee.\nFig. 4 Page rule that shows/hides the element\n![Fig.\u00a04 Page rule that shows/hides the element](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_show_field_rule.png)\nTo implement this, the **Sick leave, days left** field must be visible only if the value of the **Originator type** field is \"Employee.\" To do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the \"Employee\" originator type:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the **\"Originator Type\" attribute** in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the \"**Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n5. Select the \"**Employee\" lookup value**.\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, show the **Sick leave, days left** field:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 \"**Show elements.** \"\n2. Select the element type to show in the **Which element will be shown?** block. For this example, select **Input**. This opens a window.\n3. Select the field to show on the page, e. g., **Sick leave, days left** , and click **Select**.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will show the **Sick leave, days left** field only for requests whose **Originator type** field is set to \"Employee.\" If the **Originator type** field is set to any other value, Creatio will hide the **Sick leave, days left** field.\n## Make a field required or optional\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that makes elements required under specific conditions.\nExample\nMake the **Start date** and **Due date** fields on a request page required for requests whose **Type** attribute is \"Vacation.\"\nFig. 5 Page rule that makes the element required\n![Fig.\u00a05 Page rule that makes the element required](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_make_field_required_rule.png)\nTo do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the \"Vacation\" type:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the **\"Type\" attribute** in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n5. Select the **\"Vacation\" lookup value**.\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, make the **Start date** and **Due date** fields required:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 \"Make elements required.\"\n2. Select the element type to make required in the **Which element will be required?** block. This opens a window.\n3. Select the fields to make required on the page, e. g., **Start date** and **Due date** , and click **Select**.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will make the **Start date** and **Due date** fields required for requests whose **Type** field is set to \"Vacation.\" If the **Type** field is set to any other value, the fields mentioned will be optional.\n## Enable or disable an element\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that enables or disables any page component under specific conditions. For fields, this means making them editable or read-only.\nExample\nMake the **Owner** field on a request page read-only for requests whose **Status** attribute is \"Done\" or \"Canceled.\"\nFig. 6 Page rule that makes the element read-only\n![Fig.\u00a06 Page rule that makes the element read-only](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_make_field_read_only_rule.png)\nTo do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the \"Done\" or \"Canceled\" status:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the **\"Status\" attribute** in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n5. Select the **\"Done\" lookup value**.\n6. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n7. Select the **\"Status\" attribute** in the new row.\n8. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n9. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n10. Select the **\"Canceled\" lookup value**.\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, make the **Owner** field read-only:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 \"Make elements read-only.\"\n2. Select the element type to make required in the **Which element will be read-only?** block. This opens a window.\n3. Select the fields to make required on the page, for example, **Owner** , and click **Select**.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will make the **Owner** field read-only for requests whose **Status** field is set to \"Done\" or \"Canceled.\" If the **Status** field is set to any other value, the field will be editable.\n## Apply a static filter\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that will apply filter to the list of values in the lookup field. This will make the list shorter.\nExample\nShow only employees in the **Contact** lookup field for internal requests.\nFig. 8 Business rule for static filtering by lookup values\n![Fig.\u00a08 Business rule for static filtering by lookup values](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_filter_static_values_rule.png)\nTo do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to internal requests:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select **Attribute** in the **IF** block \u2192 \"Request category.\"\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Select **Lookup** \u2192 \"Internal requests.\"\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, filter the **Contact** field to only have employees:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Apply static filter**.\n2. Select the lookup field for the static filter in the **Filter** field. For example, select \"Contact.\"\n3. Click **Setup filter** to configure the static filter. A modal will open.\n4. Click **Add condition** to add a new static filter condition. A dialog box will open.\n5. Select the name of the field whose value will be used in the current static filter condition in the **Column** lookup. For example, select \"Type\" and click **Select**. This will close the dialog box and add a static filter condition.\n6. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon to update the static filter condition. This will open a modal with the lookup values for the **Type** field of the **Contact** entity.\n7. Select all eligible checkboxes (for example, \"Employee\") and click **Select**. This will close the dialog box.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , when the \"Internal requests\" lookup value is selected in the **Request category** field, only contacts of the **Employee** type will be available in the **Contact** field on the requests form page.\n## Filter lookup values based on another lookup\u200b\nYou can make lookup fields in forms more user-friendly and efficient by setting up filtering rules based on another lookup. When one lookup field depends on the value of another, you can configure Creatio to show only the relevant choices in the dependent field based on what was selected in the first field. You can also set the dependent field to automatically clear its current value if the filtering field changes, and autopopulate with a new value if available. These behaviors are enabled by default in Freedom UI's custom business rules, making forms more intuitive and reducing manual data entry.\nExample\nFilter cities by the country selected in the **Country** lookup field for requests that must be related to a given location.\nFig. 7 Business rule for filtering by lookup values\n![Fig.\u00a07 Business rule for filtering by lookup values](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_filter_lookup_values_rule.png)\nTo filter lookup values based on another lookup:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the **Country** field filled in:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Click **Add rule** in the **Requests business rules** block in the left pane.\n3. Select **Attribute** \u2192 \"Country\" \u2192 \"Is filled in.\"\n4. Select **\"Is filled in.\"**\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, filter the **City** field to only have cities that are located in the current country:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Apply filter**.\n2. Select the lookup field to filter in the **Filter** field. For this example, it is the \"City\" field.\n3. Select the lookup field whose value will be used to filter the other field in the **By** field. For this example, select \"Country.\"\n4. Business rules created in Creatio 8.0.10 and later have automatic clearing and population of lookup values enabled by default. **To disable automatic clearing** , clear the **Clear value...** checkbox. **To disable automatic population** , clear the **Populate value...** checkbox.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , when a \"Country\" lookup value is selected, the lookup options for the **City** field on the request page will be filtered based on the selected country.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Freedom UI Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376)\n[Create a custom app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2377)\n[Set up the app UI](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2379)\n[Tech Hour: UI/ UX Building pages in Freedom UI Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyqnRbUHnjQ)\n[Tech Hour: UI/ UX Best practices in Creatio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdoiOu9ncmw)",
