  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3All Creatio products\nOn this page\nIn Creatio, all base telephony features, such as receiving incoming calls, making outgoing ones, putting calls on hold and transferring calls to another number, are available in the communication panel. To display the **Calls** tab, click the ![btn_com_open_cti_panel.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/btn_com_open_cti_panel.png) button.\nYou can also [set up phone integration](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/more_apps/phone_integration_connectors) to enable call management in Creatio, and use a headset to make and receive calls.\n## Make calls\u200b\nOutgoing call can be made in several ways. You can either dial the number manually on the communication panel, make a call using the calls history or click the call button on the contact page.\n### Dial by phone number\u200b\nIf you know the phone number that you want to call:\n1. **On the Calls tab, enter the phone number in the tab field** , then click the call button or press the **Enter** key (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Manual dial\n![Fig.\u00a01 Manual dial](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_outcome_call.png)\nYou can also make a call by clicking the call button next to the name of the intended subscriber in the calls history (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Dial from the calls history\n![Fig.\u00a02 Dial from the calls history](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_outcome_call_from_history.png)\n2. **Wait for the connection** (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 An outgoing call\n![Fig.\u00a03 An outgoing call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_outcome_call_unknown.png)\nIf the connection is successful, the call will be switched to the conversation mode (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 A successful call\n![Fig.\u00a04 A successful call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_outcome_call_unknown_connected.png)\n3. **Click the![end call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/btn_cti_end_call.png) button** to end the call.\n### Dial by the contact's name\u200b\n1. **Enter the contact's name** in the tab field on the **Calls** tab. If you don\u2019t know the contact\u2019s full name, there is an autofill functionality included. The system will search for contacts whose name contains the entered name fragment and will display those contacts on the tab.\nnote\nTo start searching, you need to enter at least three characters.\n2. **Find the needed subscriber in the list** and click the call button next to the phone number you want to call (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Search for a subscriber by name\n![Fig.\u00a05 Search for a subscriber by name](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_outcome_call_several_abonents.png)\n3. **Wait for the connection**.\n### Quick dial from record pages\u200b\nYou can call a contact/account from the contact/account page.\n**To start a call from the contact page** :\n1. **Click the phone number or the call button next to the number you want to call** on the communications detail (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Quick dial from the record page\n![Fig.\u00a06 Quick dial from the record page](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_quick_dial.png)\n2. **Wait for the connection**.\n## Receive calls\u200b\nBy default, this section is hidden. It expands on the right-side panel of the screen when you receive an incoming call (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 An incoming call\n![Fig.\u00a07 An incoming call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_income_call_unknown.png)\n1. **Click the answer call button or pick up the phone** if the button is unavailable to start the conversation.\n2. **Click the end call button** to decline a call.\nnote\nThe type of the Call Center used in Creatio determines whether the answer button is displayed for an incoming call or not. For example, the answer button is unavailable when working with Asterisk Call Center. If your telephone network supports this feature, and you would like to use it, open the Call Center's use parameters setup page and select the **Enable picking up phone from application** checkbox. The setup page can be opened from the user profile.\n## Identify the caller\u200b\nIn Creatio, a subscriber is identified by their phone number during any call.\n1. If a subscriber (a contact or an account) is identified by the phone number while calling, their name will be displayed in the call panel (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Identify the subscriber\n![Fig.\u00a08 Identify the subscriber](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_income_call_one_abonent.png)\n2. If the same phone number is used for more than one contact or account, a list of those subscribers will be displayed in the call panel. To select the intended subscriber, click the subscriber's record in the list (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Select one of the contacts found by the phone number\n![Fig.\u00a09 Select one of the contacts found by the phone number](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_income_call_several_abonent.png)\n3. If you need to change the selected subscriber, open the additional menu next to the subscriber's name and select the **Select another record** option (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Select another subscriber\n![Fig.\u00a010 Select another subscriber](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_income_call_other_abonent.png)\nnote\nThe information about the selected subscriber will be saved in the call history in the **Calls** section.\nIf a subscriber is not identified by a phone number while calling, at the end of the call you will be able to create a contact or an account or connect a call to the existing contact or account via the calls history.\n## Put calls on hold\u200b\nWhile you are in a call, you can put the call on hold so that the subscriber is still on the line but cannot hear you.\n**Click the![btn_cti_pause_new.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/btn_cti_pause_new.png) button on the call panel** to put a call on hold. Click the ![btn_cti_pause_on_new.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/btn_cti_pause_on_new.png) button to resume conversation.\nnote\nThe call cannot be transferred or finished while it is on hold.\n## Transfer calls\u200b\nWhile you are on a call, you can transfer the call to another phone number. When using the Avaya, Webitel, Finesse, TAPI, and Asterisk connectors, blind (unconditional) transfer is available for all calls.\nnote\nTo enable blind transfer, select the **Use blind transfer** checkbox in the user profile.\nTo transfer the call to another agent without interrupting the call:\n1. **Click the![btn_cti_transfer_new.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/btn_cti_transfer_new.png) button on the call panel**. An additional field will be displayed. Use this field to enter the phone number that you want to transfer the call to. The calls history will also become available in the tab. Use it to transfer the call to a subscriber that you recently contacted.\n2. **Enter the phone number or select the needed subscriber from the calls history** and click the call button (Fig. 11). You can also find the intended subscriber by name.\nFig. 11 Dial when transferring the call\n![Fig.\u00a011 Dial when transferring the call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_call_transfer_input_number.png)\nThe call will be put on hold, and the system will start establishing the connection with the subscriber whom you transfer the call to. The information about subscribers will be displayed on the call panel (Fig. 12).\nFig. 12 Connect to another subscriber when transferring the call\n![Fig.\u00a012 Connect to another subscriber when transferring the call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_call_transfer_transfering.png)\n3. **Put down the phone** to quickly transfer the call. Both subscribers will be connected, and you will be disconnected from the conversation.\n4. **Wait for the connection with the subscriber** to whom you are transferring the call to make an attempted transfer. If the connection is successful, the call panel will display additional buttons you can use to finish the transfer or to cancel it (Fig. 13).\nFig. 13 Talk to a subscriber while transferring the call\n![Fig.\u00a013 Talk to a subscriber while transferring the call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_call_transfer_answer.png)\n## Make and receive video calls\u200b\nWith Creatio, you can make video calls if Webitel integration is configured and set up. Video communication is available only for internal calls.\nYou can enable/disable video calls in Creatio. To manage video calls setup:\n1. **Open the user profile page** by clicking the **Profile** image button on the main page of the application.\n2. **Click the Call Center parameters setup button**.\n3. **Click the Use video checkbox** on the displayed page to enable/disable video calls.\nWhen video calls are enabled, during the call, you will see the video feed of the user that the connection is established with and will also share your own video feed.\nIn the video call mode, the communication panel also contains the video area and video call controls, such as a seek bar and timer that indicates time passed since the call's start.\n## Check the calls history\u200b\nYou can view the recent calls history in the communication panel. It is unavailable if the user is in conversation mode or searching for a subscriber. The recent calls history is also available when transferring a call to another number.\nThe calls history chronologically displays the recent incoming, outgoing and missed calls, on top of brief information about the accounts/contacts that a connection was established with (Fig. 14).\nFig. 14 The calls history\n![Fig.\u00a014 The calls history](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_call_history_example.png)\nnote\nThe number of calls displayed in the recent calls history can be configured with the \"Number of records on the \"Calls history\" tab\" system setting.\nnote\nDo not close the browser window when making a call via the Creatio interface in order to properly save call history. If the window was closed during the conversation, the call's duration and end time will not be saved.\nThe calls history only displays information about the latest communication session with a specific subscriber. For example, if you call several numbers specified in the **Communication options** detail of a contact, the calls history will display one record for this contact using the number that was dialed last.\nIf you called a subscriber and you now need to call another of their numbers, go to the contact/account page from the calls history and **make a call from the subscriber's page**.\nTo do that, **click the name of the contact/account** in the call's history. It is displayed as a link (Fig. 15). The subscriber page will open. On the page, select the subscriber's number from the numbers available in the **Communication options** detail. You can directly call from the contact/account page by clicking either the phone number or the call button next to the number on the **Communication options** detail.\nFig. 15 Open a contact page from the call's history\n![Fig.\u00a015 Open a contact page from the call's history](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_call_history_go_to_page.png)\nIf the same phone number is associated with several subscribers (contacts/accounts) in the system, different subscribers will be identified when the connection is established, and the call's history will display separate records for each contact/account (Fig. 16).\nFig. 16 The calls history for one number associated with several users\n![Fig.\u00a016 The calls history for one number associated with several users](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_call_history_same_number.png)\nIn addition to viewing completed incoming and outgoing calls, you can create a contact or account, connect the call with an existing contact and display connected activities. To process a call, use the menu, which you can open by clicking the ![scr_cti_button.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/scr_cti_button.png) button (Fig. 17).\nFig. 17 The call processing menu\n![Fig.\u00a017 The call processing menu](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_add_smt.png)\nTo **add a contact** to the call's subscriber, select **Create contact**. The new contact page will open. After saving the contact, the corresponding phone number will be automatically added to the **Communication options** detail. By default, \"Mobile phone\" will be set as the communication option type.\nYou can **add an account** based on the call's subscriber. To do this, select the **Create account** menu command. After saving the account, the corresponding phone number will be automatically added to the **Communication options**. By default, \"Primary phone\" will be set as the communication option type.\nTo **connect a call to an existing contact or account** , select the **Add to existing contact** menu command and select corresponding record from the lookup. The phone number from the call will be added to the **Communication options** detail of the selected record.\nTo display call connections to contacts, accounts and other records, select the **Show all connections** menu command. Connected account, contact and activity will be displayed below the general call information (Fig. 18).\nFig. 18 The call connections\n![Fig.\u00a018 The call connections](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_history.png)\nYou can connect the call to a system record by selecting a record type in the menu and clicking the ![scr_cti_button_choose.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/scr_cti_button_choose.png) button (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19 Bind a call\n![Fig.\u00a019 Bind a call](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/manage_calls/scr_cti_add_activity.png)\n## Record calls\u200b\nRecording and the playback of calls is available in Creatio if your Call Center supports this feature. Call recording and playback rules can be set up in Webitell, for example.\nnote\nAdditional setup is required to enable call playback.\nTo play a call record, go to the **History** tab of the needed contact or account. Select the needed call record on the **Calls** detail and click the **Play** button (Fig. 20).\nFig. 20 Play a call record\n![Fig.\u00a020 Play a call record](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/scr_cti_start.png)\nCall records are played in a web player with basic playback options (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21 The record playback\n![Fig.\u00a021 The record playback](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/scr_cti_listen.png)\nYou can also download the call's record as an audio file by selecting the **Download audio file** menu command (Fig. 22).\nFig. 22 Download the call record file\n![Fig.\u00a022 Download the call record file](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/scr_cti_down.png)\n## Change your agent status\u200b\nThe agent status menu is displayed when you click the user image located in the top right corner of the screen (Fig. 23).\nFig. 23 The agent status menu\n![Fig.\u00a023 The agent status menu](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_cases/scr_cti_operator_status.png)\nThe list of available agent statuses depends on the telecommunications system that is used and can be set up in the **User status for message exchange** lookup.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Phone integration connectors](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/more_apps/phone_integration_connectors)\n[Check notifications and process tasks](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1839)\n[Work with approvals](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1833)\n[Work with emails](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1020)\n[Work with chats](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2378)\n[Coordinate across multiple time zones](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1901)",
