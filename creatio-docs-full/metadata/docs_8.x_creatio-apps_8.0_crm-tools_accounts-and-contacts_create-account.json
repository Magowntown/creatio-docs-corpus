For example, the data on the number of employees can be used to estimate the size of the company.\nnote\nThe term \"account\" corresponds to \"legal entity\" in Financial Services Creatio products. Legal entities include customer companies, partners, competitor banks, subsidiaries, and branches of your bank, as well as insurance companies that you interact with. The **Accounts** section corresponds to the **Legal entities** section in Financial Services Creatio products.\nIn Creatio, an account can be:\n* added manually\n* [imported](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1252) from Excel\n* saved manually or automatically during [lead qualification](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1216) (available in Sales Creatio and Marketing Creatio)\nTo add a new account record:\n1.
