  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nTo set up a CallWay integration, take the following steps:\n1. Set up Creatio Messaging Service. Read more >>>\n2. Set up the message exchange library. Read more >>>\n3. Set up the CallWay parameters. Read more >>>\nIn Creatio, the CallWay integration functionality requires a separate license. You need to generate a license request, send it to our service team, upload the received license file into the system, and distribute the licenses among the users. Read more: [Creatio licensing](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1264) and [Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1472).\nThe integration is only possible if complete preliminary CallWay setup was performed by the phone integration administrator.\nImportant\nIf you set up the telephony for a Creatio production environment, deploy Creatio Messaging Service on a separate node rather than on the Creatio application server. To ensure the fault tolerance of your phone integration, we recommend setting up at least two nodes with Creatio Messaging Service, as well as a balancer that would redirect users in case of lost connection with one of the nodes.\n## 1\\. Set up Creatio Messaging Service (formerly Terrasoft Messaging Service)\u200b\nThe messaging service allows you to connect Creatio to CallWay via the integration protocol and distribute call events between Creatio users.\n1. Before installing Creatio Messaging Service (CMS), make sure that your computer runtime environment has:\n* A .NET Framework package version 4.7.2 or later on the server where you are going to install Creatio Messaging Service.\n* At least 2 Gb of RAM and 20 Gb of free drive space.\n2. Contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to receive the messaging service installation files or download the files via the URL: [Download Creatio Messaging Service](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/downloads/CreatioMessagingService/7.18.0.808.zip). Unpack the archive to a folder to ensure a smooth installation. If you run the installation directly from the archive, the archiver application may interfere with the install wizard.\nImportant\nDeploy CMS on the server connected to both the Creatio application server and the PBX. Read more: [Telephony integration basics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15751).\n3. Run the Creatio Messaging Service Install.msi file on the machine intended as the message exchange server and proceed with the installation.\n4. Make sure that the \"TerrasoftMessagingService\" service is running in the Windows Services application. If the \"TerrasoftMessagingService\" service is not running, start it manually.\n5. Open the folder with the service files: ~\\BPMonline Messaging Service. Specify the CallWay server address in the \"Terrasoft.Messaging.Service.exe.config\" file:\n<callway url=\"CallWay_server_address\" login=\"XXX\" password=\"XXX\" port=\"34600\" restoreConnectionInterval=\"2000\" />  \nSee the **list of configuration file parameters** in the table below.\nParameter caption| Parameter function  \n---|---  \nurl| CallWay server IP address parameter.  \nlogin| Integration protocol login and password.  \npassword  \nport| Integration protocol port. By default, \"34600.\"  \nrestoreConnectionInterval| The time interval to reconnect the integration messaging service to the CallWay phone integration server if a failure occurs. The value is specified in milliseconds and is \"2000\" - by default.  \n6. Test the phone integration.\nnote\nFollow this [instruction](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2343&anchor=title-1974-14) if you need to update the Creatio Messaging Service.\n## 2\\. Set up the message exchange library\u200b\nMessage exchange library selection and setup is performed once by the system administrator.\n1. Open the system designer by clicking ![btn_system_designer.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/More_Apps/phone_integration_connectors/btn_system_designer.png) in the top right corner of the application window.\n2. Click \"System settings\" in the \"System setup\" block.\n3. In the \"Default messages exchange library\" (\"SysMsgLib\" code) system setting, set the default value to \"Telephony integration library based on Callway protocol.\"\n4. Specify the message service connection parameters. To do this, open the \"Message exchange server\" (\"SysMsgServerNode\" code) system setting. In the **Default value** field, specify the message exchange network address in the following format: \"ws://0.0.0.0:2013\" if your website is served over HTTP or \"wss://0.0.0.0:2013\" if your website is served over HTTPS, where:\n* \"0.0.0.0\" \u2013 IP address that your Creatio users use to access your message exchange server.\n* \"2013\" \u2013 the port used by default for connecting to the messaging service. You can change the port number in the \"Terrasoft.Messaging.Service.exe.config\" file.\nnote\nIf your website is served over HTTPS and secure (WSS) connection is used for WebSockets, you will need to install a security certificate on the message exchange server and specify it in the configuration files of the message service. Learn more: [Configure a WSS phone service connection](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1755).\n5. Click **Save**.\n## 3\\. Set up the CallWay parameters\u200b\nThese settings must be applied for each Creatio user who received CallWay integration license. Use the user login credentials to access the system.\n1. Open the user profile page by clicking the **Profile** image button on the main page of the application.\n2. Click the **Call Center parameters setup** button.\n3. On the opened page, fill out the required values:\n1. **Disable Call Center integration** \u2013 this checkbox allows you to disable Creatio integration with the phone service. The call button will not be displayed on the communication panel of the application.\n2. **Agent internal number** \u2013 CallWay user phone number.\n3. **Routing rule** \u2013 specify the routing rule if it is required for the CallWay configured server.\n4. **Use CallWay client** \u2013 select the checkbox if an employee uses CallWay internal client. While using the CallWay internal client, the answer button in the application becomes available.\n5. **Enable debugging** \u2013 this checkbox allows you to display troubleshooting information within the browser console. This troubleshooting information can be used when the phone integration runs into problems and the customer addresses the service team.\n4. Click **Save**.\n5. Refresh the browser page to apply the changes.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Set up integration with Asterisk](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1368)\n[Set up integration with Avaya](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1373)\n[Set up integration with Cisco Finesse](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1369)\n[Set up integration with TAPI](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1370)\n[Set up integration with Infinity X](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1372)",
