  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0Service Creatio\nOn this page\nProcess Creatio cases in the **Cases** section or in the [agent desktop](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1072).\nCases are processed according to a predefined business process. You can set up a custom business process and use it for processing cases from separate queues.\n## Start processing a case\u200b\nTo begin working on a case, select a case in the **Cases** or **Agent desktop** section list. After you open the case, select the \"In progress\" status on the workflow bar (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Start processing a case\n![Fig.\u00a01 Start processing a case](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/scr_section_service_requests_change_case_ctage.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will change the case status to \"In progress\" and specify the current user in the **Assignee** field. The customer will be notified that you started processing the case and given the resolution deadline by email.\nAfter you resolve the case, transfer it to the following stage using the workflow bar.\nnote\nIf you want to return to the **Cases** section list automatically after saving the case, select the **Close on save** checkbox in the \"Case statuses\" lookup. Learn more: [Set up case statuses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1449).\n### Notify the assignee/assignee group about the case\u200b\nIf a case with **Assignee** and/or **Assignee group** case fields filled out becomes active, Creatio will notify the assignee/assignee group. Creatio will also notify the assignee/assignee group if the assignee/assignee group is specified for an active case.\nnote\nThe case is considered active if its status is \"New,\" \"In progress,\" \"Reopened.\"\nIf the **Assignee** field is filled out, Creatio will notify the assignee. The **Assignees group** field can be either empty or filled out.\nIf the **Assignees group** field is filled out and the **Assignee** field is not, Creatio will notify the assignee group. In this case, the **To** field will be populated with emails of every group member.\nSet up the content of the notification sent to the assignee/assignee group in the **Message templates** lookup. By default, the notification uses the \"Specifying case assignee\" template.\n### Diagnose and resolve an incident\u200b\nService Creatio, enterprise edition includes the \"Creating and processing tasks for case diagnostic and resolution\" process that runs if the following conditions are met:\n1. A customer support agent was assigned to an incident. The incident status is \"New\" or \"In progress.\"\n2. The status of an inactive incident changes to \"New,\" \"In progress,\" \"Reopened.\" The **Assignee** field is filled out.\n3. An incident is escalated to a support agent.\nCreatio adds a task for the responsible agent as part of the resolution process. When an agent modifies the incident, Creatio closes the task according to the following rules:\n1. If the agent resolves the incident, Creatio will close the task with the \"Solution found\" result.\n2. If the agent cancels an incident, Creatio will change its status to \"Canceled.\" The task status will also be changed to \"Canceled\" with the identical result.\n3. If the agent postpones the resolution, Creatio will change the task status to \"Closed\" with the \"Additional information required\" result.\nIf the values in the assignee/assignee group fields change, Creatio will change the status of the connected task to \"Closed\" with the \"Escalation required\" result. In this case, Creatio may run a new sub-process instance and create a new task for the new assignee.\n### Escalate a case\u200b\nCase escalation is available in Service Creatio, enterprise edition out-of-the-box. To escalate a case to a higher support level, select the **Escalate** action from the **Actions** menu on the case page.\nThis will open the escalation page. Specify the new support level, as well as the assignee or assignee group, on the page.\nnote\nCreatio will close the incident processing task created when transferring a case to the previous status with the \"Escalation required\" result.\nA new assignee or an agent from the assignee group will continue processing the case.\n#### Reassign a case\u200b\nYou can reassign a case in Service Creatio, customer center edition. To do this, change the value in the **Assignee** or **Assignee group** field of the case page.\nA new assignee or an agent from the assignee group will continue processing the case.\n### Reclassify the case\u200b\nCase reclassification is available in Service Creatio, enterprise edition out-of-the-box. To change the service agreement, open the case page and click **Actions** \u2192 **Reclassify**.\nAs a result, Creatio will update the terms, category, and other case parameters that are determined automatically.\n### Search for case solution\u200b\nCase solution search is available in Service Creatio, enterprise edition out-of-the-box. To do this, select the **Search for similar cases** action from the **Actions** menu when processing an incident or a service request.\nThis will open a list showing cases connected to the same service, same configuration item, or marked by the same tags.\nIf the list contains any resolved cases, the knowledge base articles linked to these cases are likely to contain the solution for the current case. To access these articles, use the **Knowledge base articles** detail in the **Closure and feedback** tab of the similar resolved cases.\nIf the list contains an identical case, select it. As a result, Creatio will specify the selected case in the **Parent case** field of the current case.\nUse the **Internal note** button in the **Processing** tab to consult with other employees regarding the case resolution.\n## Communicate with the customer\u200b\nUse the ![btn_com_workflow_card_email.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/btn_com_workflow_card_email.png) **Email** and ![btn_com_workflow_card_portal_message.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/btn_com_workflow_card_portal_message.png) **Portal message** buttons on the action panel to send replies to the customer (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Add a message to display on the customer portal\n![Fig.\u00a02 Add a message to display on the customer portal](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/section_service_requests_publish_portal.png)\nClick the ![btn_service_requests_attachment.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/btn_service_requests_attachment.png) button to attach a file to an email or portal message.\nIf you send a portal message, Creatio will notify the customer by email.\nAfter you finish processing the case, for example, ask the customer for more information, change the case status to \"Waiting for response\" (Fig. 3), which indicates that the case is waiting for a customer's reply.\nFig. 3 Change the case status to Waiting for response\n![Fig.\u00a03 Change the case status to Waiting for response](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/scr_section_service_requests_change_case_ctage00001.png)\nThe customer can reply by email or by posting a message on the customer portal. The reply will appear in the **History** block (Fig. 4). Creatio will reopen the case automatically. The **Assignee** field will be cleared and the case will be returned to the processing queue.\nFig. 4 The customer communication history\n![Fig.\u00a04 The customer communication history](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/section_service_requests_publish_portal_history.png)\nTo call the customer quickly, hover over the contact name in the case profile. This will open a mini page. If the contact has phone communication options, dialing options will be available on the mini page (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Dial the customer\n![Fig.\u00a05 Dial the customer](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/section_service_requests_mini_card.png)\nYou can also [dial](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1027) the customer via the [communication panel](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1839).\n### Notify the contact about a message in the \"Portal\" feed\u200b\nA portal user receives a notification about a message in the \"Portal\" feed if they have an active email.\nConfigure the content of the notification in the **Email templates** lookup.\n## Resolution and feedback\u200b\nAfter you provide the customer with the resolution, move the case to the resolved status.\nFig. 6 Resolve the case\n![Fig.\u00a06 Resolve the case](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/section_service_requests_resolve.png)\nCreatio will notify the customer about the case resolution by email. The email will also contain the user satisfaction scale. The customer can use it to grade the contact center or support service performance. Learn more: [Set up case resolution notification](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1787#title-198-4).\nCase status will change depending on the customer satisfaction level. For example:\n* If the satisfaction level is \"1\" or \"2,\" Creatio will reopen the case, change its status to \"Reopened,\" and clear the **Assignee** field.\n* If the satisfaction level is \"3,\" \"4,\" or \"5,\" Creatio will change the case status to \"Closed.\"\nnote\nConfigure the relationship between customer satisfaction levels and case statuses in the **Satisfaction levels** lookup.\nTo expedite the resolution of similar cases in the future, link the knowledge base articles that contain the resolution to the case. If there are no such articles in the knowledge base, Creatio will suggest creating a new article automatically. By default, the article creation process is deactivated. To activate this process, go to the **Process library** section \u2192 select the needed process record \u2192 click **Activate**.\nIf you change the status of the case that contains incomplete tasks in **Service Creatio, enterprise edition** to \"Resolved\", Creatio will ask you what to do with the tasks. You can mark all tasks as completed, cancel them, or leave them unchanged.\n### Create a knowledge base article after resolving a case\u200b\nAfter you resolve the case, you can create a corresponding knowledge base article that helps to resolve similar cases. Creatio includes a sub-process that automates the article creation.\nBy default, the subprocess is inactive. To activate the sub-process:\n1. Open the System Designer by clicking the ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/btn_system_designer.png) button.\n2. Go to **Processes** \u2192 **Process library**.\n3. Clear the **Active** checkbox to display all business processes available in Creatio.\n4. Select the \"Create a new article after case resolution\" business process in the list and click **Activate** (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 Activate the Create a new article after case resolution sub-process\n![Fig.\u00a07 Activate the Create a new article after case resolution sub-process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/btn_service_requests_activate.png)\nThe \"Create a new article after case resolution\" sub-process runs as follows:\n1. When you resolve a case, the process checks the case for linked knowledge base articles.\n2. If there are none, the process will ask you if you want to create a new article. Select \"Yes\" to create a new article.\n3. After you save the article, the process will link it to the case automatically.\n### Reopen the case automatically when receiving an email or a comment on the portal\u200b\nCreatio reopens the case automatically and clears the **Assignee** field if the following conditions are met:\n1. The case status is paused or resolved yet not final.\nnote\nConfigure incident and service request statuses in the **Case statuses** lookup. In this case, the status must have the **Pause status** or **Resolved status** checkbox selected yet the **Final status** checkbox cleared. By default, \"Resolved\" and \"Waiting for response\" statuses meet these criteria.\n2. The customer sent a case email or left a comment on the portal.\nIf Creatio receives an email or a portal comment, the case status will be changed to \"Reopened\" automatically. Creatio will also clear the **Assignee** field. This is done to enable other employees to work with the reopened case.\nnote\nIf the **Assignee group** field is not cleared, every group member will receive a case notification on their agent desktop.\n### Close cases automatically\u200b\nCreatio closes cases automatically if the following conditions are met:\n1. The case status is \"Resolved.\"\n2. The case's actual resolution time is filled in.\n3. The waiting period for the evaluation of the case ended.\nnote\nSpecify the waiting period for case evaluation in the \"Number of waiting days to reevaluate resolved case\" (\"FirstReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) and \"Number of waiting days after second reminder of resolved case\" (\"SecondReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) [system settings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1259#title-1880-25).\nCreatio checks for cases that meet these conditions once a day. The status of every case that meets the conditions is changed to \"Closed.\" The automatic case closure procedure remains the same whether case evaluation is on or off.\nYou can disable the automatic case closure. To do this, clear the \"Default value\" checkbox in the \"Automatically close resolved cases\" (\"CloseResolvedCases\" code) [system setting](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1259#title-1880-25).\n## Cancel a case\u200b\nIf you created a case by mistake or the case no longer needs a response (for example, the customer resolved the issue on their own or the question is no longer relevant), select the **Canceled** stage on the workflow bar to cancel the case.\nFig. 8 Cancel the case\n![Fig.\u00a08 Cancel the case](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_processing/section_service_requests_cancel_select.png)\nCreatio will change the case status to \"Canceled\" and notify the customer by email.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1613)\n[Set up response and resolution deadlines](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654)\n[Set up \"Junk\" case registration](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1788)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Service cases](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531198)",
