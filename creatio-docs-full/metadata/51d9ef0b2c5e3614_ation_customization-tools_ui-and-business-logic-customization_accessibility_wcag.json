The platform provides a foundation for accessible apps via its built-in features, enabling no-code creators and developers to create solutions that have accessible UX. By leveraging these capabilities, no-code creators can ensure their apps are more inclusive and user-friendly. This article delves into the specific considerations and techniques required to build Creatio applications that are easy to use for everyone.\n## WCAG core principles\u200b\nThe [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) are a set of international standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content more accessible to people that have disabilities. They are based on the following core principles:\n* **Perceivable**. This principle ensures that all users can access the information, regardless of their sensory abilities. This means providing alternatives for non-text content, offering captions for videos, and ensuring content can be presented in different ways without losing its structure.\n* **Operable**. This principle enables all users to interact with the website or application. This includes making all functionality controllable from a keyboard, providing enough time for users to read and use content, and avoiding content that could cause seizures.\n* **Understandable**. This principle makes the content and interface clear and easy to comprehend. This involves making text readable and understandable, ensuring that web pages appear and operate in predictable ways, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.\n* **Robust**. This principle emphasizes that content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Robust principle maximizes compatibility and ensures that content remains accessible as technologies evolve. This means ensuring compatibility with different browsers, screen readers, and other tools on which users might rely.\n## WCAG support in Creatio\u200b\nSince version 8.2.2 Energy Creatio is compatible with WCAG 2.0-2.2 AA, Revised Section 508 standards, EN 301 549 Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services and ISO/IEC 40500. If you need information on Creatio compliance to any local accessibility standards, check whether those standards comply with international standards listed above.\nCreatio's system settings for managing accessibility features are located in the \"Accessibility\" folder in the **System settings** section.\nIt is possible to set a wallpaper that makes the page elements more visible and accessible desktop color that displays instead of the background image. These settings are performed by system administrator in the **UI Management** section. Also, user can turn on the accessible color in the user profile on the **Accessibility settings** tab if it is set up.\n## General recommendations for accessible app design\u200b\nTo ensure accessibility in app design, it is essential to implement the fundamental principles of WCAG. View best practices for implementing these principles below.\n1. Perceivable:\n* Every non-text element like images, videos, audio etc. must have a descriptive text alternative (alt text). For complex images, use detailed descriptions or long descriptions. Provide transcripts and captions for audio and video content.\n* Offer alternatives for time-based media, such as captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions. Provide controls to pause, stop, and adjust the volume of audio and video.\n* Ensure content can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure, e.g., responsive design, reflow. Avoid relying solely on sensory characteristics like shape, color, sound to convey information.\n* Use sufficient contrast between text and background colors. Don't rely on color alone to convey important information. Provide options to adjust text size and spacing.\n2. Operable:\n* Make all functionality available via a keyboard interface. Ensure a logical tab order. Provide visual keyboard focus indicators.\n* Give users enough time to read and use content. Provide options to disable or extend time limits.\n* Avoid content that could cause seizures e.g., flashing lights. Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second.\n* Provide clear and consistent navigation mechanisms. Use descriptive page titles. Provide multiple ways to find content such as search. Use labels to organize content. Ensure focus order is logical.\n3. Understandable:\n* Use clear and simple language. Avoid jargon and niche terms. Provide definitions for unfamiliar terms. Ensure content is easy to read and understand.\n* Make pages open and operate in predictable ways. Use consistent navigation and layout. Avoid unexpected changes in context.\n* Help users avoid and correct mistakes. Provide clear error messages. Use descriptive labels and instructions.\n4. Robust:\n* Ensure compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.\n* Test using multiple browsers and assistive technology.\n**Additional recommendations** :\n* Integrate accessibility into the design and development process from the beginning.\n* Use automated tools and manual testing with assistive technologies to identify accessibility issues.\n* Include users that have disabilities in the testing process to get real-world feedback.\n* Create an accessibility statement or policy that outlines your commitment to accessibility.\n* Keep up-to-date with the latest WCAG guidelines and best practices.\n* Make sure all instructions are easy to understand.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio VPAT](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2573)\n[Overview of Freedom UI Designer and its elements](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376)\n[Manage apps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2377)\n[Set up the app UI](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2379)\n[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)\n[Tech Hour: UI/ UX Best practices in Creatio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdoiOu9ncmw)",
