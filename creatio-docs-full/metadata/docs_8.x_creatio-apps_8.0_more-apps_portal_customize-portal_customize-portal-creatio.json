  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nYou can set up the portal login page, the portal main page, portal user and organization profiles, as well as add existing and custom sections to the portal.\nnote\nTo turn on Freedom UI for external users, follow the steps in a separate article: [Turn on Freedom UI](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2446).\n## Set up the portal login page\u200b\nThe login page is the first page the users see after loading the URL of your Creatio instance. The primary application and the portal have two different login pages. These pages have a few settings in common.\nThe login page URLs for a Creatio instance with \"<https://mysite.creatio.com>\" URL are as follows:\n* **Primary application** : <https://mysite.creatio.com/Login/NuiLogin.aspx>\n* **Portal** : <https://mysite.creatio.com/login/SSPLogin.aspx>.\nBy default, <https://mysite.creatio.com> redirects to the primary application login page. However, you can redirect this URL to the portal login page.\nWe recommend adding the following assets to the portal login page:\n* Corporate logo \u2013 you can add different logo images for the primary application and portal login pages.\n* Support phone numbers and links to any additional resources, which are displayed both on the primary application and portal login pages.\n* Data privacy notifications, cookie banners, consent checkboxes, or other regulatory tools, etc., to comply with applicable data privacy laws and requirements to provide portal users with access to your portal.\n### Change the default login page\u200b\nIf you use the portal to communicate with customers actively, you can set **the portal login page** as default. This is particularly useful if most of your portal users register on their own.\nIf you use **Creatio cloud** , contact Creatio support and have the team configure Single Sign-On on your site via a remote connection.\nIf you use **Creatio on-site** , perform the following settings in the Creatio configuration files:\n1. Modify the **Web.config** file located in the Creatio root folder.\n2. Change the value from **NuiLogin.aspx to SSPLogin.aspx**. For example:\n<authentication mode=\"Forms\">  \n<forms loginUrl=\"~/Login/SSPLogin.aspx\" protection=\"All\" timeout=\"60\" name=\".ASPXAUTH\" path=\"/\" requireSSL=\"false\" slidingExpiration=\"true\" defaultUrl=\"ViewPage.aspx?Id=4e342d5e-bd89-4b79-98e2-22e433122403\" cookieless=\"UseDeviceProfile\" enableCrossAppRedirects=\"true\" />  \n</authentication>  \n<defaultDocument>  \n<files>  \n<add value=\"SSPLogin.aspx\" />  \n</files>  \n</defaultDocument>  \n3. Save the changes.\n### Set up the logo\u200b\nYou can replace the default image on the login page with your company logo. To do this:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 \"System settings.\"\n2. Open the \"SSP Logo\" system setting (\"SSPLogoImage\" code).\n3. Click the **Clear value** button to delete the old logo.\n4. Click **Select file** and upload the new logo. Recommended image size: 37x274 pixels. If you upload a larger image, Creatio will scale it down. We recommend uploading PNG images. However, you can use other standard image formats supported by your browser.\n5. Save the changes.\n6. Clear the browser cache and refresh the page to see the changes live.\n### Set up phones and links\u200b\nYou can display contact options on the login page, e. g., sales department or customer support phone numbers, as well as any additional resources. This data will be displayed both on the primary application and on the portal login page.\n#### Add contact options\u200b\nTo add contact options to the login page:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 \"Lookups\".\n2. Open the \"Communication options for login page\" lookup.\n3. Click **New**.\n4. Specify the name of the contact option, e. g., \"Support\", and add a phone number.\n5. Click **OK**.\n6. If you need to add multiple contact options, repeat steps 3-5 for each option.\n#### Add links\u200b\nTo add links to the login page:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 \"Lookups.\"\n2. Open the \"Useful links for login page\" lookup.\n3. Click **New**.\n4. Specify the name of the link, e. g., \"Official website,\" and add a URL.\n5. Click **OK**.\n6. If you need to add multiple links, repeat steps 3-5 for each link.\nIf user self-registration is not required, you can **remove the \"Register\" button from the portal login page** :\n* For **Creatio on-site** , change the ShowPortalSelfRegistrationLink parameter in the Web.config file to:\n<add key=\"UseStaticFileContent\" value=\"false\" />  \n* For **Creatio in the cloud** , contact Creatio support.\n## Set up the portal main page\u200b\nThe portal main page provides quick access to the most up-to-date information and common functionality. You can configure the main page, e. g., add the list of the user\u2019s cases or the knowledge base article search widget.\nnote\nAll portal users have permission to read the main page data.\n**The default portal main page contains the following elements** (Fig. 1):\n* A welcome banner (1)\n* A knowledge base article search bar (2)\n* A list of popular knowledge base articles (3)\n* A list of cases the portal users submitted (on the self-service portal) (4)\nFig. 1 Self-service portal main page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Self-service portal main page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_basic_main_page.png)\nThe main page is displayed right after the login by default. You can choose to display a portal section, e. g., **Knowledge base** as a start page instead. Specify the start page in the \"Portal start page\" (\"SSPMainPage\" code) system setting.\nnote\nIf you change the portal start page, the changes will only affect new portal users. To apply changes to existing portal users, change the value of the **Home page** field on the user page manually.\n**System administrators** must set up the portal main page in the primary application.\nTo do this, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 **\"** Portal main page setup **.\"**\nnote\nYou can set up the portal main page only if you have permissions for the \"Access to portal main page setup module\" (\"CanManagePortalMainPage\" code) [system operation](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=258).\nAs a result, the portal main page setup area will open (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Portal main page setup\n![Fig.\u00a02 Portal main page setup](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_main_page.png)\nHere you can **set up** :\n* The welcome banner.\n* Custom lists.\n* Charts and other analytics.\nWhen configuring the portal main page, **keep in mind the portal user access permissions**. In Creatio, the portal user access permissions are limited by and comply with the \"least access\" principle, which means users are prohibited to perform any action to which they do not have explicit permission. If the main page contains information that the users do not have permission to read, the portal will not display this information for such users. For example, if the main page contains a chart based on the **Contacts** section data, the users without permission to read the \"Contact\" object data will not be able to view this chart.\nTherefore, when you configure the portal main page:\n* First and foremost, consider the default permissions granted to portal users. For example, you can set up the list of knowledge base articles liked by the current portal user, and the list will be displayed on the portal main page.\n* If you want to supplement the portal main page with dashboards containing data that portal users have no permission to read, set up the corresponding permissions in the **Object permissions** section. Learn more in a separate article: [Manage Portal Creatio in the main application](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2456).\n### Set up the main page banner\u200b\nYou can display a custom image on the portal main page. It can be a banner that conveys the style and spirit of your company. Configure the banner as a separate **web page**. Create a separate web page on your website similar to the default banner on the portal to display a custom image.\nTo do this:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 \"Set up portal main page.\"\n2. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_menu_gear.png) \u2192 **Edit**.\n3. Double-click the \"Website with image\" block.\n4. Specify the **title** , the **page URL,** and **styles** (optional).\n5. Save the changes.\n### Set up custom widgets on the main page\u200b\nTo make it more convenient for the users, the portal main page displays lists of their records in the main portal sections. The list on the customer portal displays the popular knowledge base articles, while the list on the self-service portal displays the knowledge base articles and customer cases. Configure these lists using developer tools in the \"Widget\" dashboard tile. Additionally, you can add **custom lists** with custom sorting, e. g., a list of user requests. However, such lists will not have the **Go to** button. Configure these lists similar to the \"List\" dashboard tile in the primary application. Learn more in a separate article: [Set up dashboards](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2144).\nnote\nSimilar to the base dashboard tiles, you can add the custom widget dashboard tile to the main page using developer tools. Learn more in the developer documentation: [Add a custom dashboard widget](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15605).\n### Set up the main page tabs\u200b\nYou can add several tabs to the main page to display additional data, e. g., case stats (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Tabs on the portal main page\n![Fig.\u00a03 Tabs on the portal main page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_main_page_tabs.png)\nTo **add a new tab** to the portal main page:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 \"Set up portal main page.\"\n2. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_menu_gear.png) \u2192 **Add** (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Add a new tab to the page\n![Fig.\u00a04 Add a new tab to the page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_main_page_adding_new_tab.png)\n3. The portal tab content setup process is similar to that of dashboard tabs. Learn more in a separate article: [Set up dashboards](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2144).\nAs a result, the portal will display all configured tabs on the main page. **Navigate** the tabs by clicking their titles.\nnote\nThe tabs are displayed in alphabetical order. The user will see the first tab in the list upon login. When setting up the tabs, you need to take their titles into account.\nNote that the portal will not display the tab setup area on the main page if there is only one tab in it.\n## Set up the user and organization profile\u200b\nConfigure the profiles of the portal users and portal organizations in the section wizard to add existing fields and details, as well as create new ones. You can add as many fields and details to the profile as necessary.\nThis functionality is only available to users who have permission for the \"Access to \"Access rights\" workspace\" (\"CanManageAdministration\" code) system operation.\nnote\nSince Creatio version 8.0.9 \"Portal user\" user type and \"All portal users\" root role were renamed to \"External user\" and \"All external users,\" respectively.\n### Set up the user profile\u200b\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/images/2020-11/btn_system_designer_0.png) \u2192 \"Set up portal user profile page.\"\n2. Add new or delete existing fields and details in the Section Wizard (Fig. 5).\n3. Save the changes.\nFig. 5 Setting up the portal user profile page\n![Fig.\u00a05 Setting up the portal user profile page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/chapter_portal_setup_userprofile_page_settings.gif)\n### Set up the organization profile\u200b\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/images/2020-11/btn_system_designer_0.png) \u2192 \"Set up portal organization page.\"\n2. Add new or delete existing fields and details in the Section Wizard (Fig. 6).\n3. Save the changes.\nFig. 6 Setting up the portal organization page\n![Fig.\u00a06 Setting up the portal organization page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/chapter_portal_setup_organization_page_settings.gif)\nnote\nLearn more in a separate article: [Set up a homepage](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2352).\n## Set up portal sections\u200b\nConfigure the portal sections in the **Section Wizard** of the primary application. Section management capabilities depend on the portal configuration:\n* If you use the **self-service portal** , you can modify the existing portal sections but cannot add new sections.\n* If you use the **customer portal** , you can add up to 3 custom sections and configure them using the Section Wizard.\nYou can add any Creatio object to the section page. For example, a detail, a field, etc. The number of available objects depends on the portal configuration and is restricted by the license conditions. For example, you can add up to 300 objects to a self-service portal page, up to 1500 objects to a customer portal page, and up to 3000 objects to a partner portal page. If the number of objects on the section\u2019s record page exceeds these limits, the portal will switch to \"read-only\" mode.\n### Add an existing section\u200b\nThe ability to display existing sections on the portal and the number of portal sections are restricted by the terms of the user license.\nTo add an existing section to the portal:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_3.png) \u2192 \"Set up view\" \u2192 \"Workplace setup.\"\n2. Select the needed workplace with a \"Portal\" type from the list \u2192 **Open**.\n3. On the **Sections** detail, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_add_tab_3.png) \u2192 select the section \u2192 **Select**.\nAs a result, the section wizard will open. You will be able to set up the section properties on the **Portal** tab (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 Portal section setup page in the Section Wizard page\n![Fig.\u00a07 Portal section setup page in the Section Wizard page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_section_wizard_adding_new_section.png)\nAs a result, the section wizard will open. You will be able to set up the section properties on the **Portal** tab:\n1. Creatio populates the **Title** field with the name of the section that is visible to portal users. You can specify a different title, if necessary.\n2. Creatio also populates the **Code** field, and it cannot be edited. The **Code** field contains the section code developers use when editing the section\u2019s source code.\n3. You can change the standard **section icon** , which will be displayed in the portal\u2019s side panel. Hover over the current icon and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_add_userpic.png) to change the section icon. We recommend using a white icon on a transparent background. Icon format: *.png or *.svg, size: 38x38 px.\n4. Click **Set up page** to open a blank editor page. Set up the page in the same manner as a primary application page. Learn more in a separate article: [Set up a homepage](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2352).\n5. Select the **Enable approval in section** checkbox to enable [approval functionality](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1831) in the section.\nnote\nCreatio grants access permissions for fields and details added to the portal page automatically when you edit the portal sections in the Section Wizard. To allow a user to access a new portal section, make sure that the necessary object is managed by records and the portal user has sufficient object permissions. Learn more in a separate article: [Manage Portal Creatio in the main application](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2456).\n4. Save the changes in the window and the Section Wizard.\nAs a result, the selected section of the primary application will be added to the portal workplace (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 TheDocumentssection on the portal\n![Fig.\u00a08 TheDocumentssection on the portal](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_documents_section_added.png)\n### Add a new section\u200b\nYou can add new custom sections to the portal only in the customer and partner portal configurations.\nTo add a custom section to the portal:\n1. Create a new section in the primary application using the **Section Wizard**. Learn more in a separate article: [Create a new section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1245).\nSpecify any workplace of the primary application, e. g., \"General\" in the **Workplace** field in the main properties of the section (Fig. 10).\nnote\nPlease do not specify the \"Portal\" workplace, since you must create a new section in the primary application before adding the section to the \"Portal\" workplace.\nFig. 9 Select the workplace for a new portal section\n![Fig.\u00a09 Select the workplace for a new portal section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/More_Apps/portal/cuztomize_portal_creatio/scr_chapter_portal_setup_new_section_workplace_choice.png)\n2.
