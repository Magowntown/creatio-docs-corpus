  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nWhatsApp is a Meta product. Due to this, you need the following to integrate this messenger:\n* A **Meta Business Manager** account. If you have not signed up yet, follow the [Meta instructions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347).\n* Integration with a Facebook partner platform that provides access to WhatsApp Business API. You can use **Twilio**.\nYou can sign up for a trial account with limited functionality to **get acquainted** with the WhatsApp integration features. **Verify your accounts** to take full advantage of WhatsApp integration. This will help you secure your and your customers' data. In general, the WhatsApp integration setup consists of the following steps:\n1. Set up a Twilio free trial account to get acquainted with the integration (optional). [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2355&anchor=title-2025-1)\n2. Set up a Twilio business account. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2355&anchor=title-2025-4)\n3. Set up a WhatsApp chat channel in Creatio. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2355&anchor=title-2025-5)\nFile transfer in WhatsApp channel is **limited** to:\n* **Receiving files**. At the moment, Creatio only works with incoming files, sending files is not available.\n* **File size** up to 16 Mb.\n* **File formats** :\n* Images: *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png.\n* Audio files: *.mp3, *.ogg, *.amr.\n* Documents: *.pdf.\n* Videos: *.mp4.\nTo enable Twilio to send media files, turn off the **HTTP Basic Authentication for media access** setting in Twilio. Learn more about supported file formats in [Twilio documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/guidance-whatsapp-media-messages).\nnote\nTwilio is partnered with telecom service providers in a limited number of countries. View the country list in [Twilio documentation](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000781088-International-Porting-Process). Besides the specified countries, Twilio has no restrictions on US phone numbers. If your number is not eligible, follow [Twilio instructions](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052171393-Can-I-activate-my-own-phone-number-for-WhatsApp-on-Twilio-).\nWhile you can connect multiple WhatsApp numbers to a single Creatio instance, we recommend connecting a particular WhatsApp number only to a single Creatio instance. If you add the number to several instances, e. g., development, testing, and production environments, only the last integrated instance will receive messages.\n## Set up a trial account (optional)\u200b\nYou can set up a Twilio free trial account without verification and subscription to paid platform services. This will let you test Creatio WhatsApp integration, including messaging and file transfer. To set up the test integration:\n1. Set up a Twilio free trial account. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2355&anchor=title-2025-2)\n2. Set up a WhatsApp chat channel in Creatio [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2355&anchor=title-2025-3)\n### Set up a Twilio free trial account\u200b\n1. **Sign up** on <https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio>. You will be able to set up a test integration after the signup. Twilio will grant you limited virtual funds to help you review the functionality.\nnote\nShould you decide to convert the account to a full-fledged business account, the trial features and virtual funds will become unavailable. We recommend using separate accounts for working and testing purposes.\n2. **Specify the endpoint URL** for transferring chats to Creatio. To do this, navigate to the sandbox settings in Twilio:\n[Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) \u2192 Messaging \u2192 Try it out \u2192 Send a WhatsApp message \u2192 Sandbox Settings \u2192 Sandbox Configuration and enter the `https://sm-receiver.creatio.com/api/webhook/LeadGen/whatsapp` value in the **WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN** field.\n3. **Set up the Twilio sandbox** : [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) \u2192 Messaging \u2192 Try it out \u2192 Send a WhatsApp message.\n4. Twilio will generate a code. **Send the code** from your phone number to your trial account number using WhatsApp. Twilio will notify you upon success. As a result, Twilio will add your number to Sandbox Participants.\n5. If you would like to use several test numbers, **repeat step 3** for each of them. To review the test numbers in the Sandbox Participants list, go to Twilio Console \u2192 Messaging \u2192 Try it out \u2192 Send a WhatsApp message \u2192 Sandbox settings \u2192 Sandbox Participants. After that your trial account number will be able to receive messages from the numbers you added in the previous step.\n### Set up a test WhatsApp channel in Creatio\u200b\nBefore you start setting up the WhatsApp channel, make sure the following system settings are populated:\n* \"Identity server Url\" (\"IdentityServerUrl\" code)\n* \"Identity server client id\" (\"IdentityServerClientId\" code)\n* \"Identity server client secret\" (\"IdentityServerClientSecret\" code)\nIf the values of these system settings are not populated, contact Creatio support.\n1.

If your company **already has an account** , proceed to step 2.\n2. If your company **does not have an account yet** , follow the instructions in [Meta documentation](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347).\n2. **Sign up** for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).\n3. **Submit the WhatsApp sender** to Twilio.\n1.

To approve the request:\n* Go to business.facebook.com \u2192 Settings \u2192 Business Settings \u2192 Requests \u2192 **Approve**\n* Follow the link in the initial phone number confirmation email\n4. **Verify your Meta Business Manager account**. If you have already verified your business account, proceed to the next step. To verify your business account:\nGo to Meta Business Manager \u2192 Settings \u2192 Business Settings \u2192 Security Center and click the **Start verification** or **Continue** button in the **Verification** section.\nLearn more about verifying the business in [Meta documentation](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347).\nAfter you approve Twilio to message on your behalf, Twilio will complete the registration process for your WhatsApp sender. You will receive an email confirmation that Twilio finalized the registration of your profile.\n**As a result** , you will be able to communicate with customers using WhatsApp via the registered number within 24 hours after the verification.\n## Add a WhatsApp channel to Creatio\u200b\nBefore you start setting up the WhatsApp channel, make sure the following system settings are populated:\n* \"Identity server Url\" (\"IdentityServerUrl\" code)\n* \"Identity server client id\" (\"IdentityServerClientId\" code)\n* \"Identity server client secret\" (\"IdentityServerClientSecret\" code)\nIf the values of these system settings are not populated, contact Creatio support.\n1.
