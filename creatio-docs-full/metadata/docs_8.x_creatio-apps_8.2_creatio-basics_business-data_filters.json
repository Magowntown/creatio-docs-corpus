  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2All Creatio products\nOn this page\nYou can filter records in the **lists** , **calendars** , **analytic widgets** , and **galleries** in Creatio. The following tools can be used to search and filter records in sections:\n* Quick filters\n* Advanced filters\n## Quick filters\u200b\nCreatio sections can have **quick filters** (Fig. 1). You can use a quick filter to filter data by the most frequently used conditions of date/time, by lookup, or by a created, custom condition.\nnote\nNo-code creator that has sufficient permissions can set up quick filters for any section. Learn more: [Set up quick filter components](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2458).\nFig. 1 Quick filter in the Calendar section\n![Fig.\u00a01 Quick filter in the Calendar section](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/scr_quick_filters_new.png)\nFor example, the **Calendar** section of the **Productivity** app contains a quick filter as it is needed to analyze employee activity during a specified period of time.\nCreatio saves the filter settings when the page is updated when you switch sections or log out and log back in to Creatio. To remove a quick filter by time period or lookup, click the ![btn_com_quick_filter_cancel.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_cancel.png) button in its right part. To remove a custom quick filter, clear or select its checkbox depending on the filter settings.\n### Quick filter by time period\u200b\nYou can filter records by one date or date range, for example, to display the activities for the current or previous week.\nThe filter includes the presets by day, week, month, and quarter. You can also set a custom period by specifying its start and end dates using the built-in calendar.\nnote\nPrevious, current, and next week, month, and quarter are actual calendar weeks, months, and quarters. For example, if the previous month was December, then when you select the \"Previous month\" period in the **Activities** section, the activities will be displayed for the period of time between 1st and 31st of December.\nTo set up a custom filter period, select the start and end date of the period using the built-in calendar. You can open the calendar by clicking the start or end date of the period (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Using the filter by time period\n![Fig.\u00a02 Using the filter by time period](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/gif_using_a_filter_by_time_period.gif)\n### Quick filter by lookup\u200b\nApply a filter by lookup to display records by one or more lookup values. For example, in the **Calendar** section of the **Productivity** app, the filter displays records by activity participants.\nTo view data by one or more values, click the filter select the needed values in the drop-down menu.\n### Custom quick filter\u200b\nYou can use a filter in the form of a checkbox that applies or cancels a preconfigured condition. For example, the **Calendar** section of the **Productivity** app has a filter that displays closed activities. To manage this filter, select or clear the checkbox.\n## Advanced filters\u200b\nYou can use folders to apply a more complex record filter that has multiple search parameters and conditions.\nnote\nThe setup procedure is similar to setting up pre-configured static filters in the **list** , **calendar** , or **gallery** in Freedom UI Designer. Learn more: [Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1235&anchor=#title-753-2), [Static filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2561)\nTo apply the advanced filter, select a dynamic folder and click ![btn_filter.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_filter.png) (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Set up folder filter\n![Fig.\u00a03 Set up folder filter](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/scr_folder_filter.png)\nIf you will require the configured filters in the future, you can save a dynamic folder by them.\n### Apply an advanced filter by object columns\u200b\nYou can apply filter by one of the current section columns. For example, you can filter activities by the **End date** column of the **Activity** section or contacts by the **Job Title** column of the **Contact** section.\nExample\nFilter accounts by their category in the **Accounts** section.\n1. **Open** the **Accounts** section.\n2. **Click** **Folders** \u2192 **Add**.\n3. **Type** **Category A** \u2192 press Enter.\n4. **Click** ![btn_filter.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_filter.png). This opens a window.\n5. **Click** **Add condition**.\n6. **Select** the **Category** column \u2192 **Select** (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Select a column for the advanced filter\n![Fig.\u00a04 Select a column for the advanced filter](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/scr_select_column.png)\n7. **Select the needed parameters** on the filter page:\n1. Select the condition type by clicking its character. For this example, select \"=\".\n2. Click <?>. This opens a window.\n3. Specify the values for the selected column. For this example, \"A\" \u2192 **Select**. (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Select a value for a column\n![Fig.\u00a05 Select a value for a column](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/scr_select_category.png)\n8. Specify the logical operator for the added conditions, for example, \"AND\", by clicking it (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Select a logical operator\n![Fig.\u00a06 Select a logical operator](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/scr_select_operator.png)\nOut of the box, the filter area contains one empty root group that has the \"AND\" logical operator. The \"AND\" logical operator is applied if the record must match all conditions in the group. Apply the \"OR\" logical operator if the record must match at least one of the conditions in the group.\nWhen using the \"\u2260\" condition, records that have unfilled fields are now taken into account.\n9. Click **Save**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will display only accounts whose category is \"A\" when you select the **Category A** folder.\n### Apply an advanced filter by connected object column\u200b\nYou can filter records by the columns of the current record and by the columns of the objects connected to it. For example, you can filter activities by the category of the connected account, i.e., the **Type** column of the **Accounts** section.\nExample\nFilter activities in the Tasks section by a certain type of company.\n1. **Open** the **Tasks** section.\n2. **Click** **Folders** \u2192 **Add**.\n3. **Type** **Category A** \u2192 press Enter.\n4. **Click** ![btn_filter.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_filter.png). This opens a window.\n5. **Click** **Add condition**. This opens a window.\n6. **Click** the ![btn_expand.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/btn_expand.png) button next to the object name. This adds a field.\n7. **Select** the connected object. For this example, select **Account**.\n8. **Specify the column** of the connected object in the **Column** field. For this example, \"Category\".\n9. **Click** **Select** (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 Select a column of the connected object\n![Fig.\u00a07 Select a column of the connected object](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_select_a_column_of_the_connected_object.png)\n10. **Select the needed parameters** on the filter page:\n1. Select the condition type by clicking its character, for example, \"=\".\n2. Click <?>. This opens a window.\n3. Specify the values for the selected column, for example, \"A\" \u2192 **Select**.\n11. **Click** **Save**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will display only activities that are connected to accounts of the \"A\" category when you select the **Category A** folder.\nnote\nFor example, when the filter is set up for `<Account.Type \u2260 Customer>`, activities will be displayed for the accounts that are not customers. This also applies to empty values, so accounts whose **Type** field is unfilled will also be displayed.\n### Apply the advanced filter that has grouping filter conditions\u200b\nYou can create advanced filters that have multiple logical operators.\nExample\nDisplay all customer accounts who reside in New York and those that have no city specified.\n1. **Open** the **Accounts** section.\n2. **Click** **Folders** \u2192 **Add**.\n3. **Type** **New York customers** \u2192 press Enter.\n4. **Click** ![btn_filter.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_filter.png). This opens a window.\n5. **Apply** the \"Type = Customer\" condition:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This opens a window.\n2. Select the account column, for example, \"Type\" \u2192 **Select**.\n3. Click <?> on the filter setup page. This opens a window.\n4. Select \"Customer\" \u2192 **Select**.\n6. **Apply** the \"City = New York\" condition in the same manner.\n7. **Apply** the \"City is not filled in\" condition:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This opens a window.\n2. Select the \"City\" column \u2192 **Select**.\n3. Click the condition type in the filter setup area and select the \"is not filled in\" condition from the menu.\n8. **Group** the \"City\" conditions and set a different logical operator for them:\n1. Select both \"City\" conditions while holding down Ctrl (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Select filter conditions to group\n![Fig.\u00a08 Select filter conditions to group](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_select_filter_conditions.png)\n2. Select **Actions** \u2192 **Group** (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Group filter conditions\n![Fig.\u00a09 Group filter conditions](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_group_filter_conditions.png)\n3. Set \"AND\" as the logical operator of the root group and \"OR\" as the logical operator for the newly created group by clicking the operator name (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Set a logical operator for the group of filter conditions\n![Fig.\u00a010 Set a logical operator for the group of filter conditions](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_set_an_operator_for_a_group.png)\n9. **Click** **Save**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will display only the accounts of the \"Customer\" type for which the \"New York\" value or no value is specified in the **City** field when you select the **New York customers** folder.\n### Apply an aggregate filter\u200b\nThe aggregate filter lets you filter object records by the connected records in objects that have the reverse connection. The following filter conditions can be applied in the aggregate filter:\n* **Count** : a number of the connected records exists in the object that has the reverse connection for the filtered records. For example, you can filter users who are specified in the **Owner** field for five or more accounts.\n* **Maximum/minimum** : for the filtered records, the object that has the reverse connection contains records with a specific maximum (minimum) value in the numeric or the date column. For example, you can select employee users whose last task was completed last week.\n* **Sum** , **average** : for the filtered records, the object that has the reverse connection contains the connected records that have the particular sum of values or the average value in the numeric column. For example, you can filter employee users whose average task duration is greater than two hours.\nApply the aggregate filter similarly to applying the filter by connected object columns.\nExample\nObtain a list of users who are owners of the accounts that have the \"Customer\" type.\n1. **Open** the **Contacts** section.\n2. **Click** **Folders** \u2192 **Add**.\n3. **Type** **Owners** \u2192 press Enter.\n4. **Click** ![btn_filter.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_filter.png). This opens a window.\n5. **Apply** the filter condition (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Set up a reverse connection object column in the aggregate filter\n![Fig.\u00a011 Set up a reverse connection object column in the aggregate filter](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_select_a_column_of_the_reverse_connected_object.png)\n1. Click **Add condition**. This opens a window.\n2. Click ![btn_expand.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/btn_expand.png) next to the object name. This adds a field.\n3. Select the object that has the reverse connection. For example, to apply an aggregate filter by the **Owner** column of the **Accounts** section, select \"Account (by column Owner)\".\n4. Specify the column of the object with the reverse connection in the **Column** field. For example, \"Quantity\".\n5. Click **Select**.\n6. **Select the filter conditions** in the filter setup area. For this example, the condition is \"Quantity > 5.\"\n7. **Apply** the necessary additional conditions. For example, if you need to display only those contacts that are owners for accounts of the \"Customer\" type, add this condition to the filter (Fig. 12).\nFig. 12 Apply filter conditions for an aggregate filter\n![Fig.\u00a012 Apply filter conditions for an aggregate filter](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_applied_aggregate_filter.png)\n8. **Click** **Save**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will dislpay the records only if an account for which this contact is specified in the **Owner** field exists when you select the **Owners** folder.\n### Apply filter by time period\u200b\nYou can filter records by a specific period or an exact date. For example, display all records added to the section for the last week.\nThe following types of filters by period are available:\n* Filter by exact date\n* Filter by standard period\n* Filter by annual events\n#### Filter by exact date\u200b\nTo display data whose date falls within a certain period of time, specify this period in the filter conditions.\nExample\nView the activities that took place during your business trip three weeks ago.\n1. **Open** the **Tasks** section.\n2. **Click** **Folders** \u2192 **Add**.\n3. **Type** **Business trip** \u2192 press Enter.\n4. **Click** ![btn_filter.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/filters/btn_filter.png). This opens a window.\n5. **Select the beginning** of the period for which to display records. To do this:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This opens a window.\n2. Select the needed date column, for example, \"Start\", to sort activities by the start date.\n3. Select the logical operator next to the added column (Fig. 13), for example, \"\u2265\" (greater than or equal to), to set this period as the filter start date.\nFig. 13 Select filter condition type\n![Fig.\u00a013 Select filter condition type](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_select_filter_condition_type.png)\n6. **Click** <?> \u2192 **Specify exact date** (Fig. 14).\nFig. 14 Specify the exact date of filter period\n![Fig.\u00a014 Specify the exact date of filter period](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_specify_exact_date.png)\n7. **Click** ![btn_com_filter_calendar.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online%20base/base/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_filters/btn_com_filter_calendar.png) button to open the built-in filter calendar and select the needed date (Fig. 15).\nFig. 15 Built-in filter calendar\n![Fig.\u00a015 Built-in filter calendar](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_select_filter_date.png)\n8. **Specify** the filter end date.\n1. Add the \"Due\" column to the filter condition to sort activities by the start date.\n2. Select the \"\u2264\" (less than or equal to) condition type.\n3. Select the date from the built-in calendar.\n9. **Make sure** that the \"AND\" logic operator is set for the added filter conditions.\n10. **Click** **Save**.\n**As a result** , only activities that started within the specified period will be displayed in the **Calendar** section.\n#### Standard filter periods\u200b\nTo facilitate working with filters, use standard filter periods. For example, you can easily display records for the previous, current or next week.\nStandard periods are available in the <?> link menu of the filter condition (Fig. 16).\nFig. 16 Select standard filter period\n![Fig.\u00a016 Select standard filter period](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_standard_filter_period.png)\n##### Hour\u200b\nThe menu includes options that let you display records for the previous, current, or next hour. You can also display records for a certain number of previous or next hours.\nIn addition, you can set the exact time to the minute as a filter value. To do that, select the **Exact time** option and enter the needed time value in the following format \u2013 H:MM, for example, \"2:43 PM\". Also, you can select a standard time value from the drop-down list.\nTo define the number of previous or next hours, select the **Previous hours** or **Following hours** option, respectively. Enter the needed number in the field that appears. Only integer numbers are accepted.\nThe previous, current or following hour is not an hour from the current moment, but a full hour starting from the 1st till the 60th minute, for example, from 9:00 to 9:59. Therefore, if the current time is 2:34, the following hour is the period from 3:00 to 3:59, not from 2:34 to 3:33.\n##### Day\u200b\nThe menu consists of options that let you display records for the previous, current, or next day. In addition, you can display records for a certain number of previous or next days. You can also use a specific day of the month or week as a filter value.\nTo set a specific day of the month as a filter value, select the **Day of the month** option and enter the needed date in the appeared string.\nTo set a specific day of the week as a filter value, click **Day** \u2192 **Day of the week** \u2192 select the needed day.\n##### Week\u200b\nThe menu includes options that let you display records for the previous, current or next week.\nPrevious, current or next week is a calendar period from Monday till Sunday. It is not a 7-day period starting from the current day. For example, if today is Wednesday, the next week is the period from next Monday till Sunday, not the following 7 days from the current day.\n##### Month\u200b\nThe menu includes options that let you display records for the previous, current or next month. You can also use a specific month as a filter value.\nTo set a specific month as a filter value, click **Month** \u2192 **Month <?>** \u2192 select the needed month.\nPrevious, current or next month is a calendar period. For example, if the previous month was December, then when you select the \"Previous month\" period, the records for the period from December, 1 till December, 31 will be displayed.\n##### Quarter\u200b\nThe menu includes commands that let you view records for the previous, current or next quarter.\nThe previous, current or next quarter is a 3-month period: the 1st quarter includes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd months of the year (January, February, March), the 2nd quarter includes the next three months (April, May, June) and so on. For example, if it's August, the next quarter is the period that includes October, November and December (the 4th quarter).\n##### Half-year\u200b\nThe menu includes options that let you display records for the previous, current, or next half-year.\nPrevious, current or next half-year is a 6-month period: the period from January to June is considered the 1st half-year. The 2nd half-year is the period from July to December. For example, if it is August, i.e., the 2nd half-year, then the next half-year is the time period from January to June of the next year.\n##### Year\u200b\nThe menu includes options that allow you to display records for the previous, current, or next year. You can also use a specific year as a filter value.\nPrevious, current, and next year is a calendar period. For example, if it is August 2024, the next year is the period from January through December of 2025. It is not a 12-month period starting from August 2024.\n#### Filter by annual events\u200b\nThe filter takes into account only the day and month of the filtered dates. This filter can be used to track events that repeat each year, such as holidays or noteworthy events of contacts.\nAnnual event macros are available in the <?> link menu of the filter condition (Fig. 17).\nFig. 17 Filter by annual events\n![Fig.\u00a017 Filter by annual events](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/static_filters/scr_filter_by_annual_events.png)\nThe menu consists of the following options:\n* Every year, today. Displays a list of records whose date matches the current date not counting the year. I. e., the contact's birthday is today.\n* Every year, exactly in <?>. Displays a list of records whose date will come after a specified number of days not counting the year. I. e., the contact's birthday is exactly in 5 days.\n* Every year, within \"X\" next days <?>. Displays a list of records which date falls on one of the next days not counting the year. I. e., the contact's birthday is within 5 days or less.\n* Every year, within \"X\" previous days <?>. Displays a list of records which date falls on one of the previous days not counting the year. I. e., the contact's birthday was 5 days ago or less.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Tags](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1881)\n[Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1235)\n[Excel data import](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1252)\n[Excel data export](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1864)",
