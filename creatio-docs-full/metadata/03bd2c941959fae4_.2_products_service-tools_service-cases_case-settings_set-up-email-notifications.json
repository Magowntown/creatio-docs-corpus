  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2Service tools\nOn this page\nCreatio sends automatic emails with various notifications regarding cases. Users receive emails when their cases are registered, processed, resolved, canceled, or closed.\nThe general setup procedure is as follows:\n1. Set up contact case notification rules. Read more >>>\n2. Set up email notification templates. Read more >>>\n3. Set up case resolution notifications. Read more >>>\nIf the case was registered from an email, all recipients of the original email receive notifications. By default the **From** field contains the support email that received customer\u2019s email. If the case was registered from another channel (self-service, call, etc.), the **From** field contains email of the support service specified in the \"Customer service Email\" (\"SupportServiceEmail\" code) system setting. To send notifications only to the case contact, even if they did not send the original email, enable the \"Send automatic notifications only to contact\" system setting (\"AutoNotifyOnlyContact\" code).\nSet up the mechanism that sends email notifications in the \"Send email to contact on case status change\" business process.\n## Set up contact case notification rules\u200b\nThe setup procedure is as follows:\n1. **Open the System Designer** by clicking the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/btn_system_designer_new.png) button.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 **open Lookups** section.\n3. **Open** the **Case notification rule** lookup content (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Content page of the Case notification rules lookup\n![Fig.\u00a01 Content page of the Case notification rules lookup](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/email_notifications/scr_section_service_requests_rules.png)\n4. Click **New** and **set the notification parameters** :\n**Parameter**| **Parameter value**  \n---|---  \nCase category| Select case category to apply the rule.  \nCase status| Select case status to apply the rule.  \nEmail message template| Select the template to send as a notification according to the rule.  \nUsage rule| Whether to send the notification immediately or after a delay. To configure the sending delay of the rule, specify the \"Send after a delay\" usage rule and fill out the **Sending delay, minutes** column.  \nSending delay, minutes| Specify sending delay of the notification. For example, the feedback requests can be sent after the specified time after resolving a case. This will allow the client to use the provided solution and evaluate its effectiveness.  \nQuote original email| Select the checkbox to include the text of the original case email in the notification.  \n5. **Save the changes** by clicking the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/email_notifications/btn_com_apply.png) button.\n## Set up the email notification templates\u200b\nThe email template used in each notification depends on the case status and category. For example, the \"Case closure notification\" template is used to notify the user that the case has been closed.\nUse the [Message templates lookup](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=271) to manage the notification templates.\nTo set up an email template:\n1. **Open the System Designer** by clicking the![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/btn_system_designer_new.png) button.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 **open** the **Lookups** section.\n3. **Open** the **Message templates** lookup.\n4. **Select a template** and click **Edit**. This opens the [Content Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2080) window.\n5. **Edit the text of the email**.\n6. **Add macros** to the template, if needed. For example, the #Number# macro that specifies the incident number in the message. To do this, click the ![btn_chapter_content_designer_macros.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/cases_service/BPMonlineHelp/service_cases_automatic_emailing_setup/btn_chapter_content_designer_macros.png) button and select the **Standard macros** action. If the list of preconfigured macros does not contain the required macro, use the **Custom macro** action and set up the required macro.\n#### Contents of the **Message templates** lookup\u200b\nCreatio uses the following templates to send service **notifications to the customers** :\n**Template**| **Use case**  \n---|---  \nCase registration notification| The case was registered in Creatio and is about to be processed.  \nCase processing notification| The support team started processing the case.  \nCase resolution notification| The case was resolved.  \nCase closure notification| The case was closed.  \nConfirmation of closing request| The case was closed when the customer did not reply to the question of the support agent.  \nCase canceling notification| Notifies the customer that the case has been canceled. This can occur if a case was created by mistake.  \nCase feedback request notification| The case was resolved and awaits customer feedback and evaluation of the support performance.  \nCase update: new message received| The case was updated with a new message on the customer portal. Works only for Creatio users who have Portal Creatio since previous Creatio versions and haven't transferred to new pricing model yet.  \nEmpty case email template| Required for specialized case notifications.  \nTemplate - Portal user registration| Sends an account activation link to the new external user.  \nLink for password recovery| Sends a link to password recovery page to the external user.  \nCreatio uses the following templates for sending **notifications to support agents** :\n**Template**| **Use case**  \n---|---  \nSpecifying case assignee Case assigned to group| Employee or group was appointed to a case.  \nCreating new email for case| The case was updated with a new email message.  \n## Set up case resolution notification\u200b\nWhen a case is set to the \"Resolved\" status, the user receives an email that asks to evaluate the processing quality. If no evaluation is received, an additional evaluation request is be sent. You can manage the response waiting time before sending additional evaluation request using the \"Number of waiting days to reevaluate resolved case\" (\"FirstReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) system setting.\nTo ensure Creatio sends quality evaluation emails correctly, set up the link to Creatio website that is required for gathering user feedback. Fill out the **Default value** field of the \"Website URL\" (\"SiteUrl\" code) system setting with the full website URL required to access Creatio, for example <http://creatio.com>.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1613)\n[Set up response and resolution deadlines](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654)\n## Resources\u200b\n[Application processing](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531198)",
