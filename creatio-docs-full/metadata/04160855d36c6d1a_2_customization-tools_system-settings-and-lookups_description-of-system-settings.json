  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\n## App management\u200b\n**Allow to edit your own apps from an archive** (CanEditOwnAppsFromArchive) \u2013 unlocks apps and packages whose maintainer matches the value of the \"Publisher\" (`Maintainer` code) system setting. If you enable this system setting and install an app or package, they will remain unlocked.\n## Auto numbering of records\u200b\nThe following settings are available in Creatio products that have the corresponding sections.\nSystem settings of this group facilitate automatic numbering of records, for example, invoice codes or account numbers. There are two types of settings: one specifies the static text (mask) of a number, and another one is used for saving the last generated number. For example, to generate a knowledge base article code like \"Article-23,\" where 23 is the current number of the invoice, enter the following mask: Knowledge base article-0.\nAuto numbering is enabled for the following objects:\n* \"Document\" \u2013 via the \"Document number mask\" (DocumentCodeMask) and \"Current number of document\" (DocumentLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Contract\" \u2013 \"Contract number mask\" (ContractCodeMask) and \"Current contract\" (ContractLastNumber) settings.\n* \"Account\" \u2013 via the \"Account code mask\" (AccountCodeMask) and \"Current number of account\" (AccountLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Knowledge base article\" \u2013 via the \"Knowledge base article number mask\" (KnowledgeBaseCodeMask) and \"Current number of knowledge base article\" (KnowledgeBaseLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Invoice\" \u2013 via the \"Invoice number mask\" (InvoiceCodeMask) and \"Current number of invoice\" (InvoiceLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Case\" \u2013 via the \"Case number mask\" (CaseCodeMask) and \"Current number of case\" (CaseLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Service contract\" \u2013 \"Service agreement number mask\" (ServicePactCodeMask) and \"Current number of service agreement\" (ServicePactLastNumber) settings.\n* \"Operation\" \u2013 via the \"Cash flow number mask\" (CashflowCodeMask) and \"Current number of operation\" (CashflowLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Problem\" \u2013 via the \"Problem number mask\" (ProblemCodeMask) and \"Current number of problem\" (ProblemLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Change\" \u2013 via the \"Change number mask\" (ChangeCodeMask) and \"Current number of change\" (ChangeLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Release\" \u2013 via the \"Release number mask\" (ReleaseCodeMask) and \"Current number of release\" (ReleaseLastNumber) system settings.\n* \"Order\" \u2013 via the \"Order number mask\" (OrderCodeMask) and \"Current number of order\" (OrderLastNumber) system settings.\nThe \"**Mask number...** \" system setting is used during the process of generating the number or code of record when it is created. With the help of this setting you can specify a static text (mask) preceding or following the numeric value of number or code.\nType: text (500 characters).\nThe \"**Current number of...** \" system setting is used for generating the number or code of record when it is created. Stores the numeric component of the last created record.\nType: integer.\n## Updating contact ages\u200b\nUse the settings below to manage the contact age calculation in Creatio. Read more: [Updating contact ages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2046).\n**Enable updating contact ages** (ActualizeAge) \u2013 manages the functionality of automatic update of contact ages. Disabling this system setting will disable all functionality for automatic contact age calculation. The functionality includes: automatic updating of contact ages on saving a contact record, a regular scheduled update of contact ages on their birthdays, contact age update triggered by the **Update the values in the 'Age' column** action in the **Contacts** section.\nType: Boolean. Default value: \"True.\"\n**Enable automatic daily update of the contact ages** (RunAgeActualizationDaily) \u2013 manages the daily operation of updating the contact ages. If you enable this system setting, Creatio will run a daily check for contacts who have their birthday today and update their **age**. If you disable this system setting, Creatio will still use the general age calculation functionality, but without the automatic daily updates.\nType: Boolean. Default value: \"True.\"\n**Time of automatic daily update of the contact ages** (AutomaticAgeActualizationTime) \u2013 determines the time of performing the age updates for the contacts whose birthday falls on the current day. Users can set the value manually or by running the **Schedule daily update of the \"Age\" column** action in the **Contacts** section.\nnote\nFor large contact databases, we recommend scheduling the daily update of contact ages on the non-business hours.\nBy default, the system setting value is set in the \"UTC\" format. However, if a user runs the **Schedule daily update of the \"Age\" column** action in the **Contacts** section and does not change the run time, the system setting value will be updated automatically \u2013 the time will be recalculated based on the user's time zone. For example, a user in the UTC+1 time zone runs the **Schedule daily update of the \"Age\" column** action but does not change the value in the system setting. In this case, Creatio will display the default time as \"02:30 AM\" instead of 01:30 AM and change the displayed time zone from \"UTC\" to \"UTC+1.\"\nType: time. Default value: \"01:30 (UTC).\"\nnote\nNote that if you change the time using the system setting and not via the action in the **Contacts** section, the new value will only apply after the next already scheduled age update, i. e., in 24 hours after modifying the system setting value. For example, if you change the system setting value from 01:30 AM to 04:30 AM on Monday at 3 PM, the nearest age update will occur at 01:30 AM on Tuesday and then \u2013 at 04.30 AM on Wednesday. If you change the time using the action in the **Contacts** section, the modifications will apply during the next age update.\n**Date of the last update of the contact ages** (LastAgeActualizationDate) \u2013 use this setting to view the date of the last age update (performed as per schedule or by running the section action).\n## Administration\u200b\n**Licensing company Id** (CustomerId) \u2013 stores the unique identifier of your company used for licensing purposes. Company Id is provided when purchasing licenses.\nType: text (500 characters).\n**Joined objects administering** (QueryJoinRightLevel) \u2013 manages access to viewing information from one of the joined objects. For example, when viewing information about primary contact (like job responsibility or birth date) from the **Accounts** section.\nType: integer. Default value: \"0.\" This system setting can have one of the following values:\n* \"0\" \u2013 show data only from those records in the joined object for which the current user has access;\n* \"1\" \u2013 show data only from those records in the joined object for which the current user has access. In case the user does not have access to a record, show the primary display column but only when it needs to be loaded. When adding other columns from the loaded object, Creatio does not display data, even the primary display column;\n* \"2\" \u2013 show data from all records of joined object, regardless of whether or not the user has access to them.\nImportant\nIf the current user does not have access to the \"Read\" operation for the object that contains the connected record, then the data of the connected object will not be displayed regardless of the value of the \"Joined objects administering\" system setting.\n**Term of expired license notification** (ExpireLicenseNotificationTerm) \u2013 determines when to notify the users about the need to extend Creatio licenses, in days before the expiration date. If there are no licenses for the coming term or there are not enough licenses, system administrators will see this notification in the communication panel.\nType: integer.

Default value: \"True.\"\n**MaxDopQueryHint** system setting (\"MaxDopQueryHint\" code) lets you limit the number of threads used to execute a request to the database. This can help reduce the impact of resource-intensive operations on other users. \n**Content security mode** system setting (\"CspMode\" code) determines content security policy used for your Creatio instance.\nType: lookup. Default value: \"Log violations of content security policies\" for Creatio in the **cloud** and \"Disable content security148 for Creatio **on-site**.\n## Audit log\u200b\n**Log client IP range management events** (UseAdminClientIPLog) \u2013 specifies whether to log the changes to or the deletion of the valid IP address ranges.\nType: Boolean.
