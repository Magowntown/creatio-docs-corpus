  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nBusiness rules control the page UI behavior and business logic. You can specify conditions and actions to take when those conditions are met. This lets you customize page behavior to better suit your needs, streamline data entry, enforce data standards, and improve data quality.\nTo access business rule configuration on an app page:\n1. **Click** ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/move_a_classic_ui_section_to_freedom_ui/btn_system_designer.png) in the top right \u2192 **Application Hub**.\n2. **Open the needed app** or [create a custom app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2377).\n3. **Open the page** or create a custom page.\n4. **Click** the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_open_business_rules_designer.png) button in the top right (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Open the business rules setup page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Open the business rules setup page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_open_business_rules.png)\n## View the list of business rules\u200b\nYou can set up business rules on the page or object level. After you set up a **page-level rule** , Creatio applies it to the elements only on the selected page. After you set up an **object-level rule** , Creatio applies it to every Freedom UI page that uses the corresponding object, including editable lists. You can set up multiple business rules for a page or object. The list of business rules is displayed on the business rules setup page (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 List of business rules\n![Fig.\u00a02 List of business rules](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_business_rules_list.png)\nImportant\nIf multiple rules affect the same page element, only the first rule is activated.\n* Click **Add rule** to **create a new business rule**.\n* Select a rule in the list and click its name to **view or edit the rule**.\n* Select a rule in the list and click the **Enabled** toggle in the setup area to **turn the rule on or off** (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Turn on the rule\n![Fig.\u00a03 Turn on the rule](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_turn_on_rule.png)\n* Select a rule in the list and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_dots_menu_blue.png) \u2192 **Copy** to **copy the rule**.\n* Select a rule in the list and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/btn_dots_menu_blue.png) \u2192 **Delete** to **delete the rule**.\n## Show/hide an element on a Freedom UI page\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that makes certain elements on record pages visible or hidden under specific conditions.\nExample\nShow the **Sick leave, days left** field on a request page for requests whose **Originator type** attribute is an employee.\nFig. 4 Page rule that shows/hides the element\n![Fig.\u00a04 Page rule that shows/hides the element](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_show_field_rule.png)\nTo implement this, the **Sick leave, days left** field must be visible only if the value of the **Originator type** field is \"Employee.\" To do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the \"Employee\" originator type:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the **\"Originator Type\" attribute** in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the \"**Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n5. Select the \"**Employee\" lookup value**.\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, show the **Sick leave, days left** field:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 \"**Show elements.** \"\n2. Select the element type to show in the **Which element will be shown?** block. For this example, select **Input**. This opens a window.\n3. Select the field to show on the page, e. g., **Sick leave, days left** , and click **Select**.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will show the **Sick leave, days left** field only for requests whose **Originator type** field is set to \"Employee.\" If the **Originator type** field is set to any other value, Creatio will hide the **Sick leave, days left** field.\n## Make a field required or optional\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that makes elements required under specific conditions.\nExample\nMake the **Start date** and **Due date** fields on a request page required for requests whose **Type** attribute is \"Vacation.\"\nFig. 5 Page rule that makes the element required\n![Fig.\u00a05 Page rule that makes the element required](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_make_field_required_rule.png)\nTo do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the \"Vacation\" type:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the **\"Type\" attribute** in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n5. Select the **\"Vacation\" lookup value**.\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, make the **Start date** and **Due date** fields required:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 \"Make elements required.\"\n2. Select the element type to make required in the **Which element will be required?** block. This opens a window.\n3. Select the fields to make required on the page, e. g., **Start date** and **Due date** , and click **Select**.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will make the **Start date** and **Due date** fields required for requests whose **Type** field is set to \"Vacation.\" If the **Type** field is set to any other value, the fields mentioned will be optional.\n## Enable or disable an element\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that enables or disables any page component under specific conditions. For fields, this means making them editable or read-only.\nExample\nMake the **Owner** field on a request page read-only for requests whose **Status** attribute is \"Done\" or \"Canceled.\"\nFig. 6 Page rule that makes the element read-only\n![Fig.\u00a06 Page rule that makes the element read-only](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_make_field_read_only_rule.png)\nTo do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the \"Done\" or \"Canceled\" status:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the **\"Status\" attribute** in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n5. Select the **\"Done\" lookup value**.\n6. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n7. Select the **\"Status\" attribute** in the new row.\n8. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n9. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list. This adds a lookup value field to the right.\n10. Select the **\"Canceled\" lookup value**.\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, make the **Owner** field read-only:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 \"Make elements read-only.\"\n2. Select the element type to make required in the **Which element will be read-only?** block. This opens a window.\n3. Select the fields to make required on the page, for example, **Owner** , and click **Select**.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will make the **Owner** field read-only for requests whose **Status** field is set to \"Done\" or \"Canceled.\" If the **Status** field is set to any other value, the field will be editable.\n## Apply a static filter\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that will apply filter to the list of values in the lookup field. This will make the list shorter.\nExample\nShow only employees in the **Contact** lookup field for internal requests.\nFig. 8 Business rule for static filtering by lookup values\n![Fig.\u00a08 Business rule for static filtering by lookup values](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_filter_static_values_rule.png)\nTo do this:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to internal requests:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select **Attribute** in the **IF** block \u2192 \"Request category.\"\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Select **Lookup** \u2192 \"Internal requests.\"\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, filter the **Contact** field to only have employees:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Apply static filter**.\n2. Select the lookup field for the static filter in the **Filter** field. For example, select \"Contact.\"\n3. Click **Setup filter** to configure the static filter. A modal will open.\n4. Click **Add condition** to add a new static filter condition. A dialog box will open.\n5. Select the name of the field whose value will be used in the current static filter condition in the **Column** lookup. For example, select \"Type\" and click **Select**. This will close the dialog box and add a static filter condition.\n6. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon to update the static filter condition. This will open a modal with the lookup values for the **Type** field of the **Contact** entity.\n7. Select all eligible checkboxes (for example, \"Employee\") and click **Select**. This will close the dialog box.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , when the \"Internal requests\" lookup value is selected in the **Request category** field, only contacts of the **Employee** type will be available in the **Contact** field on the requests form page.\n## Filter lookup values based on another lookup\u200b\nYou can make lookup fields in forms more user-friendly and efficient by setting up filtering rules based on another lookup. When one lookup field depends on the value of another, you can configure Creatio to show only the relevant choices in the dependent field based on what was selected in the first field. You can also set the dependent field to automatically clear its current value if the filtering field changes, and autopopulate with a new value if available. These behaviors are enabled by default in Freedom UI's custom business rules, making forms more intuitive and reducing manual data entry.\nExample\nFilter cities by the country selected in the **Country** lookup field for requests that must be related to a given location.\nFig. 7 Business rule for filtering by lookup values\n![Fig.\u00a07 Business rule for filtering by lookup values](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/business_rules/scr_freedomui_filter_lookup_values_rule.png)\nTo filter lookup values based on another lookup:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the \"Requests\" custom app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to define the conditions that trigger the business rule in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule to requests that have the **Country** field filled in:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Click **Add rule** in the **Requests business rules** block in the left pane.\n3. Select **Attribute** \u2192 \"Country\" \u2192 \"Is filled in.\"\n4. Select **\"Is filled in.\"**\n3. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block. For this example, filter the **City** field to only have cities that are located in the current country:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Apply filter**.\n2. Select the lookup field to filter in the **Filter** field. For this example, it is the \"City\" field.\n3. Select the lookup field whose value will be used to filter the other field in the **By** field. For this example, select \"Country.\"\n4. Business rules have automatic clearing and population of lookup values enabled by default. **To disable automatic clearing** , clear the **Clear value...** checkbox. **To disable automatic population** , clear the **Populate value...** checkbox.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , when a **Country** field on the request page is filled in, the lookup options for the **City** field will be filtered based on the selected country.\n## Set field values\u200b\n### Constant\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that automatically populates field values based on specified conditions. This business rule is useful for automating data entry and ensuring data consistency.\nExample\nAutomatically specify a 10% discount for orders paid with a cashless payment (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Business rule for setting field constant\n![Fig.\u00a08 Business rule for setting field constant](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/scr_add_discount_if_not_cash.png)\nnote\nThe \"Set field values\" action is currently available in object business rules and is not available in page business rules. Values are set when a new record is created or when any attribute used in the conditions changes via the UI.\nTo set field values using a business rule:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the **Order and Contract Management** out-of-the-box app that has a custom **Discount percentage** numeric field).\n2. **Click the![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/btn_edit_page.png) button** in the top right of the current app page \u2192 **Edit page**\n3. **Add a \"Discount percentage\" custom filed** :\n1. Drag a **Number** field to the canvas and open the field setup area.\n2. Enter \"Discount percentage\" in the **Title** parameter.\n3. Enter `UsrOrderDiscountPercentage` in the **Code** parameter.\n4. **Add a business rule**.\n5. **Set the filter** to define when to set the value in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule when the \"**Payment type** \" field equals \"Non-cash payment\":\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the \"**Payment type** \" attribute in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list.\n5. Select the \"**Non-cash payment** \" lookup value.\n6. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Set values**.\n2. Select the field to set a value for in the **Which field will be set?** block. For this example, select \"Discount percentage\".\n3. Hover the mouse pointer over **Set up value** and click ![](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_switch_set_value_method.png) \u2192 **Constant**.\n4. Enter a fixed value. For example, \"10\".\n7. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , when a record has the \"**Non-cash payment** \" payment type, the specified field will be automatically populated using the set value.\n### Formula\u200b\nYou can set up a business rule that automatically calculates field values based on specified conditions. Only numeric values can be used in a formula. This business rule is useful for automating discount calculations and ensuring data consistency.\nExample\nAutomatically calculate the discounted payment amount for orders based on the order discount percentage (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Business rule for setting field formula\n![Fig.\u00a09 Business rule for setting field formula](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/scr_discounted_price_rule.png)\nnote\nThe \"Set field values\" action is currently available in object business rules and is not available in page business rules. Values are set when a new record is created or when any attribute used in the conditions changes via the UI.\nTo set field values using a formula in a business rule:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the **Order and Contract Management** out-of-the-box app that has a custom **Discount percentage** numeric field).\n2. **Click the![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/btn_edit_page.png) button** in the top right of the current app page \u2192 **Edit page**\n3. **Add a \"Discount percentage\" custom filed** :\n1. Drag a **Number** field to the canvas and open the field setup area.\n2. Enter \"Discount percentage\" in the **Title** parameter.\n3. Enter `UsrOrderDiscountPercentage` in the **Code** parameter.\n4. **Add a \"Discount amount\" custom filed** :\n1. Drag a **Number** field to the canvas and open the field setup area.\n2. Enter \"Discount amount\" in the **Title** parameter.\n3. Enter `UsrOrderDiscountAmount` in the **Code** parameter.\n5. **Add a business rule**.\n6. **Set the filter** to define when to calculate the value in the **IF** block. For this example, apply the rule when the \"**Payment type** \" field equals \"Non-cash payment\":\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select the \"**Payment type** \" attribute in the new row.\n3. Leave the \"=\" (equal) sign as it is.\n4. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/btn_business_rule_question.png) icon and select the **\"Lookup\" field type** in the drop-down list.\n5. Select the \"**Non-cash payment** \" lookup value.\n7. **Set up the action** that implements the needed business logic in the **THEN** block:\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Set values**.\n2. Select the field to set a value for in the **Which field will be set?** block. For this example, select \"Discount amount\".\n3. Click **Set up formula**. This will open the **Formula designer**. The designer has numeric fields from the same object as the selected target field available, with the exception of the target field itself.\n4. Click **Payment amount** \u2192 **Add**.\n5. Click **Discount percentage** \u2192 **Add**.\n6. Enter the formula: `#OrderRecord.PaymentAmount# * (100 - #OrderRecord.UsrOrderDiscountPercentage#)/100`.\n8. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , when a record has the \"**Non-cash payment** \" payment type, the specified field will be automatically calculated using the discount percentage.\nImportant\nWhen switching from **Formula** to **Constant** , your previously created formula might be lost. Also, it is not possible to set an empty value using the \"Set field value\" action.\n## Use user roles in business rule conditions\u200b\nStarting from Creatio version 8.2.2, you can set up business rules that take into account the current user's roles. This lets you customize the interface and behavior based on organizational and functional roles.\nExample\nShow the \"Approval\" field only to users that have the \"Manager\" role (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Business rule based on user role\n![Fig.\u00a010 Business rule based on user role](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/scr_enable_finance_manager_role_to_see_approval.png)\nTo set up a business rule based on user roles:\n1. **Open the needed section** (for example, the **Order and Contract Management** out-of-the-box app) and **add a business rule**.\n2. **Set the filter** to check the user's role in the **IF** block:\n1. Click **Add condition**. This adds a condition row.\n2. Select **System setting** \u2192 **Current user role**.\n3. Leave the **contains** operator as is.\n4. Click **<?>** \u2192 **Lookup**. Creatio will select \"System administration object\".\n5. Select the role from the list, for example, \"Finance. Managers group\".\n3. **Set up the action** in the **THEN** block. For example, to show the **Approval widget** :\n1. Click **Add action** \u2192 **Show elements**.\n2. Select the element to show, for example, `OrderApprovalWidget`.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will show the **Approval** field only to users who belong to the finance manager role. Other users will not see this field.\n## Debug business rules\u200b\nSince Creatio 8.2.1, Creatio provides built-in debugging capabilities to help you identify and resolve issues with business rules. When a business rule encounters an error during execution, the system displays informative messages in the browser console to guide you through the troubleshooting process.\n### Console debugging\u200b\nThe console provides specific details about which business rule failed and why, helping you quickly identify and fix the issue.\nTo access the browser console:\n1. **Open your browser's developer tools** (typically F12 or right-click \u2192 Inspect).\n2. **Go to the Console tab**.\n3. **Reproduce the error** by performing the action that triggers the business rule.\n4. **Review the error messages** to identify the problematic business rule and its specific issue.\n### Business rule identification\u200b\nTo help you map console error messages to specific business rules in the Designer, each business rule displays its title and code in the business rule setup area. You can view these identifiers in the right panel when editing a business rule (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Business rule title and code in the setup area\n![Fig. 11 Business rule title and code in the setup area](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/business_rules/scr_business_rules_setup_area_debugging.png)\nThe **Title** field shows the human-readable name of the business rule, while the **Code** field displays the unique system identifier. Both values are read-only and automatically generated by Creatio.\n**As a result** , when you encounter a business rule error, you can quickly locate the problematic rule in the Designer by matching the information from the console error message to the business rule details displayed in the setup area.\n### Debug business rule errors example\u200b\nExample\nDebug a business rule that calculates taxable payment amounts but encounters a division by zero error due to formula issues and missing field validation.\n1. **Open the needed section** , for example, **Orders** in the **Order and Contract Management** app.\n2. **Open the page** that contains the needed business rule.\n3. **Open your browser's developer tools** (typically F12 or right-click \u2192 Inspect).\n4. **Go to the Console tab**.\n5. **Reproduce the error** by performing the action that triggers the business rule.\n6. **Review the error messages** to identify the problematic business rule and its specific issue. In this example the console displays:\nBusiness rule execution error: Rule Title - \"Set values: Taxable Amount\", Rule Code - \"BusinessRule_122153b\". Error message: \"Error: Invalid operation: division by zero.\"  \n7. **Click** ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/btn_edit_page.png) in the top right of the current app page \u2192 **Edit page**.\n8. **Ensure** the following fields are present and correctly configured:\n* **Primary Payment Amount includes VAT** field is a **Checkbox** type with code `UsrIncludesVAT`.\n* **Taxable Payment Amount** field is a **Number** type with **Currency** format and code `UsrTaxableAmount`.\n* **VAT Rate** field is a **Number** type with **Decimal (0.01)** format and code `UsrVATRate`.\n9. **Locate the problematic business rule** using the **Rule Title** from the console error message (e.g., \"Set values: Taxable Amount\") and click on its name in the business rules list. You can verify it's the correct rule by checking that the **Code** field matches \"BusinessRule_122153b\" when you open the rule.\n10. **Review the rule conditions** in the **IF** block to confirm they match the expected trigger: **Primary Payment Amount includes VAT** attribute with \"=\" operator set to **true** (Boolean field type). This condition tells Creatio that the payment amount already includes VAT, so it should calculate the taxable amount by removing the VAT.\n11. **In the THEN block, open the Set values action** for **Taxable Payment Amount** and **review the formula** :\n#OrderRecord.PrimaryPaymentAmount# / ( 1 * #OrderRecord.UsrVATRate# )  \nThe problem is that the formula uses **1 * VAT Rate** instead of **1 + VAT Rate** for correct tax calculations. This causes division by zero when VAT Rate is 0.\n12. **Fix the formula** :\n1. Click **Set up formula** to open the **Formula designer**.\n2. Replace the incorrect formula with the correct formula:\n#OrderRecord.PrimaryPaymentAmount# / ( 1 + #OrderRecord.UsrVATRate# )  \n13. **Save the changes**.\n14. **Test the corrected business rule** by triggering the same action that previously caused the error.\n**As a result** , the business rule will execute successfully without division by zero errors, and the **Taxable Payment Amount** field will be calculated correctly using proper VAT calculations.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Freedom UI Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376)\n[Create a custom app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2377)\n[Set up the app UI](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2379)\n[Tech Hour: UI/ UX Building pages in Freedom UI Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyqnRbUHnjQ)\n[Tech Hour: UI/ UX Best practices in Creatio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdoiOu9ncmw)",
