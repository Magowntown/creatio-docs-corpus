  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Service\nOn this page\n**Creatio Service** is a multi-channel customer service platform. Use it to establish a single service center for internal and external customers.\nCreatio Service functionality is based on the Creatio Studio no-code platform. The composable architecture streamlines app development and customization. With drag-and-drop UI designer, employees that do not have a technical background can build and customize full fledged business solutions in no time without any coding. Creatio platform also includes a comprehensive business process designer. Creatio Service naturally synergizes with other Creatio apps and products as well as ready-made solutions on [Creatio Marketplace](https://marketplace.creatio.com/).\nCurrently, the product includes the following **composable apps** :\n* Customer 360\n* Productivity\n* Knowledge Base\n* Case Management\n## Features\u200b\n* 360\u00b0 customer view\n* Multi-channel service\n* Case management\n* Knowledge management\n* Activity management\n* Service level management\n* Unified service center\n* Service efficiency evaluation\n* AI tools\n* Creatio Marketplace plugins, addons and templates\nCreatio Marketing includes all technologies and tools available in Creatio platform. Learn more: [Platform overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1).\n### 360\u00b0 customer view\u200b\nCreatio Service lets you maintain a single database of contacts and accounts. You can draw up a complete overview of customer journey through your support center, including contact details, available services, and the entire interaction history. Use this data to build a comprehensive view of the customer and help you maintain optimal customer relationships.\nThe \"**Accounts** \" section contains information about **companies** : your customers, partners, contractors, and suppliers. Use it to access the means of communications, profiles of the contact persons, the industry, the structure and relationships of the organization.\nThe \"**Contacts** \" section provides full information on the **contact persons** of customers and partners, employees of your company, private customers, as well as other business and personal contacts. Use it to access communication options, service history, and more.\nCreatio Service tools let you **segment your customer base** in any way you need. For example, you can add priority customers to favorites or group companies by industry and employee number, service level and case rate for quick access.\nFig. 1 Contact page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Contact page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_contact_page.png)\nLearn more: [Customer 360](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/customer-360).\n### Multi-channel service\u200b\nCreatio Service is invaluable for **communication**. Call or message your customers using multiple channels directly from Creatio and keep the history of customer interaction in one place. This helps to establish personalized communication and identify the customer regardless of the currently used communication channel.\nCalls, emails, sections available for external users, messengers, and other means of communication are always available in Creatio. Reach your contacts at any time and get more details about the customer case. You can view the **history of customer service** for each account and contact.\nFig. 2 Account page\n![Fig.\u00a02 Account page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_account_page.png)\nLearn more: [Communications](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/communications).\n### Case management\u200b\nUse the **Cases** section to process support cases of internal and external customers. Creatio includes manual and automated case registration. For example, when an employee encounters a problem, they can register a case manually. Creatio can register a case automatically based on a call, email, request from a landing page, or message from an external user.\nUse Creatio Service to manage the entire service life cycle using preconfigured case management processes or dynamic cases that enable agents to handle service cases flexibly. Agents can escalate cases to resolve incidents of any complexity level quickly.\nThe Creatio **AI technology** can speed up case routing. For cases registered from the emails to the support service, the system will automatically determine the service, and assignee group.\nCreatio Service provides tools for gathering and processing **feedback** to ensure better quality of provided services. Set up feedback collection from your customers using CSAT, NPS or any other metrics that your company uses.\nFig. 3 Case page\n![Fig.\u00a03 Case page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_case_page.png)\nLearn more: [Case Management](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/case-management).\n### Knowledge base\u200b\nYou can use Creatio Service together with a unified **knowledge base** that accelerates case resolution. Enrich your knowledge base with answers to the frequently asked questions, equipment specs, and other sought-after information. You can also set up different access levels for the items in the knowledge base and their relations. The answers will be easy to find for everyone, including your customers, partners, and agents.\nFig. 4 Knowledge base page\n![Fig.\u00a04 Knowledge base page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_knowledge_base_page.png)\nLearn more: [Knowledge Management](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/knowledge-management).\n### Activities\u200b\nAgents can use the **Calendar** and **Tasks** sections to better organize their workflow. Managers can use these sections to keep track of employee performance and optimize the workload of your support center.\nFig. 5 Calendar page\n![Fig.\u00a05 Calendar page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_calendar_page.png)\nLearn more: [Productivity](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/productivity).\n### Service level management\u200b\nThe \"**Services** \" section of Creatio Service provides a single storage for the services provided regardless of the size of your support service and the scale of your infrastructure. The \"**Service agreements** \" section lets you arrange different service levels for customers and partners.\nLearn more: [Case Management](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/case-management).\n### Unified service center\u200b\nSet up **case queues** in Creatio Service to manage the flow of cases with their priorities and other parameters in mind. Configure different queues based on your company\u2019s operational standards for service agents. For example, you can use filters to set up dynamic queues or add explicitly specified records to static queues. A queue can be either open or closed. Open queues enable agents to select a case record while closed queues hide case records until the agent starts working on the case. Creatio Service also enables users to delete cases from queues if they no longer require processing, distribute workload between agents, and assign case owners for processing specific queue items.\nThe **Agent desktop page** in Creatio Service enables support agents to streamline their workflow greatly. Employees can use the desktop page to process case queues, communicate with customers, route cases, exchange data in the feed area, and track their KPI.\nFig. 6 Agent desktop page\n![Fig.\u00a06 Agent desktop page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_agent_desktop_page.png)\nLearn more: [Contact center tools](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/contact-center-tools).\nYour customers and partners can use the **sections available for external users** to register cases by themselves, find solutions in the knowledge base, and provide feedback without delay thanks to working in the same environment as support. This can decrease the load on your support service units by giving the users convenient self-service tools.\nLearn more: [Access management](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/category/access-management).\n### Service efficiency evaluation\u200b\nThe analytics tools in Creatio Service provide real-time assessment of the workflow dynamics. You have complete access to information about the most popular services and their quality, thorough customer case statistics, and individual KPI of each employee. You can visualize stats in multiple ways, including charts, calculated indicators, and special lists.\nThe analytics is available in the following areas:\n* **Agent homepage**. This page displays the comprehensive KPIs of a specific agent, such as the number of cases waiting for response, active cases by priority, and activity by day.\n* **Agent desktop**. This page displays the most important KPIs for the agent, such as active cases, number of processed cases, and average rating.\nYou can customize existing dashboards. It is also possible to add new analytics widgets to any Freedom UI page in a few clicks.\nFig. 7 Dashboard page\n![Fig.\u00a07 Dashboard page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/service_creatio_overview/scr_dashboard_page.png)\nLearn more: [Analytics](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/analytics).\n### AI tools\u200b\nUse AI tools to speed up routine tasks and increase the performance of your employees. Creatio Service includes the following machine learning models:\n* The **lookup field** value prediction models that can be used to predict case service, group, and priority as part of initial case processing.\n* The **text similarity** prediction model that can be used to search for similar cases and help agents to find the solution for the current case.\nLearn more: [AI tools](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/ai-tools).\n### Creatio Marketplace plugins, addons and templates\u200b\n**Creatio Marketplace** provides hundreds of out-of-the-box software solutions, connectors, extensions, plugins, addons and templates for Creatio products, including items that help you expand your service center.\nUse Creatio Marketplace to get a ready-made solution immediately, speeding up system integration and adaptation.\nYou can also use the Creatio Marketplace platform to share your own apps and monetize them.",
