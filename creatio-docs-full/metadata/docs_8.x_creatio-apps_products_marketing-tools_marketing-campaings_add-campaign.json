  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Marketing\nOn this page\nUse the **Campaigns** section in Creatio to plan and conduct marketing campaigns. Inform customers about your upcoming events, invite participants, get in touch with the contacts who are interested in your products and nurture your customer needs using personalized email correspondence.\n## General campaign workflow\u200b\nPlanning and running automated marketing campaigns in Creatio involves more than simply adding a new record in the **Campaigns** section. A campaign may require adding new records in other sections, for example, new emails. The general workflow for most campaigns is as follows:\n1. **Define the goal** , the target audience, and the communication chain that has potential or existing customers.\n2. **Add a new campaign** in the **Campaigns** section and fill out the campaign profile. Build a campaign diagram using the Campaign Designer elements.\n3. **Create records** (emails, events, and landing pages) that you plan to include in the campaign. Connect the campaign diagram elements to records in the corresponding sections.\n4. **Start the campaign** and follow its progress in the campaign progress check. Creatio manages the status of campaign participants by analyzing their responses.\nnote\nStarting campaigns utilizes the available active contact licenses. We recommend carefully reviewing the starting elements in the campaign diagram to ensure that only the necessary participants are included in the campaign.\n## Fill out campaign profile\u200b\nTo run a campaign in Creatio, add a new record in the **Campaigns** section. To do this:\n1. **Open** the **Campaigns** section.\n2. **Click** **New**. This opens a mini page.\n3. **Fill out** the fields on the mini page:\nParameter| Value  \n---|---  \nName| The name of the campaign.  \nGoal| The goal of the campaign.  \nUtm_campaign| The UTM mark that contains the campaign name. Required to track the lead sources received as a result of the campaign.  \n4. **Click** **Save**. This adds the record of the new campaign.\n5. **Open the record** of the new campaign in the list.\n6. **Specify** the following parameters:\nParameter| Value  \n---|---  \nStart mode| Campaign start/stop options. You can start and stop campaigns manually or set up automatic start and end of a campaign at the specified time.\n* \"manual\": the campaign will be started/stopped manually by clicking the **Start campaign** / **Stop campaign** button. Use this option for testing purposes or when you want full control over the flow progress.\n* \"at the specified time\": select this option to start/stop the campaign automatically at the specific date and time. Creatio displays the start/end time of a campaign in the time zone of the user who created the campaign. Use this option when you need to run the campaign at specific time periods, such as for promotions or during times of increased user activity. Selecting this option enables additional **Scheduled start date** / **Scheduled end date** fields where you can specify the scheduled start and end time.  \nEnd mode  \n7. **Save the changes**.\nAs a result, a new campaign record will be added to the **Campaigns** section. You can proceed with creating a [campaign diagram](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1487) in the Campaign Designer.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Monitor campaigns](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1670)\n[Campaign element reference](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1487)",
