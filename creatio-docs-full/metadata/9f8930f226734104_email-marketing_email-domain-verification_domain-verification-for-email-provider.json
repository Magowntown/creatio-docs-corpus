  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nTo send bulk emails in Creatio, verify your email address and the corporate domain.\nIn this case, your recipients who use Microsoft Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail and other common mailing services, will see that an email was sent from your provider's server on your behalf (this information is available in the \"From\" field). For example, if you are sending emails via Elastic Email, the \"From\" field of the emails may contain the following text: \"Creatio `<info@creatio.com>` via elasticemail.com\".\nTo verify your email addresses and domain, perform the following steps:\n1. Add your corporate domain to the **Bulk email settings** page. Read more >>>\n2. Obtain SPF and DKIM records. Read more >>>\n3. Create a DMARC record. Read more >>>\n4. Add the necessary records to the DNS area of your domain. Read more >>>\nImportant\nIf your domain is unverified, the provider limits your daily number of emails to 500.\nnote\nOnly custom email domains can be verified. Public domains (for example, gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.) cannot be verified. We do not recommend using public domains for bulk emails. Such emails have a high risk of being marked as spam and ruining the reputation of the sender IP address.\n## Add corporate domain to the Bulk email settings page\u200b\nTo start sending the emails, perform the following settings:\n1. Select **Email settings** in the **Bulk emails** section of the actions menu (Fig. 1)\nFig. 1 Open the email settings page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Open the email settings page](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/domain_verification/scr_section_email_bulk_settings_page.png)\n2. On the **Email settings** page, specify the domain of the necessary email address in the **Sender domain** area, i.e., \"mycompany.com\" (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Sender domains area\n![Fig.\u00a02 Sender domains area](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_domain_verification/BPMonlineHelp/email_domain_verification_elastic_email/scr_section_email_sender_domains.png)\n## Obtain SPF and DKIM records\u200b\nSPF and DKIM records are generated automatically in the **Email** section once the domain is added to the email settings page.\nTo obtain these records, in the **Emails** section, select **Email settings** in the **Actions** menu.\nThe SPF and DKIM records will be generated automatically in the **DKIM/SPF setup instructions** area on the **Bulk email settings** page (Fig. 3) for your specified domain once your email is verified.\nFig. 3 SPF and DKIM keys for the specified domain\n![Fig.\u00a03 SPF and DKIM keys for the specified domain](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/domain_verification_for_the_elastic_email_provider/scr_section_email_spf_dkim_record_values.png)\nSPF and DKIM records are identical for all domains.\n## Create a DMARC record\u200b\nSince February 2024, Google and Yahoo have implemented new email authentication requirements for all email senders to improve deliverability and prevent spam. Besides SPF and DKIM records, DMARC record is also required.\nMicrosoft has also updated their rejection policies for non-compliant bulk email senders since May 2025. For domains sending over 5,000 emails per day, Outlook, Hotmail, Live.com mail clients require compliance with SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Non\u2010compliant messages will first be routed to Junk. If issues remain unresolved, they might be rejected eventually. Learn more on the official Microsoft blog: [Strengthening Email Ecosystem: Outlook\u2019s New Requirements for High\u2010Volume Senders](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefenderforoffice365blog/strengthening-email-ecosystem-outlook%E2%80%99s-new-requirements-for-high%E2%80%90volume-senders/4399730).\nCreatio does not require a DMARC record to validate a domain. Analyze your marketing strategy and decide whether a DMARC record is required in your case, for example, if you have a lot of recipients that use Gmail, Outlook, or other clients.\nA DMARC record follows this pattern:\nv=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:user@domain.com; ruf=mailto:user@domain.com;  \nConfigure the exact parameters based on your business goals. View them in the table below.\n**Parameter name**| **Parameter value**  \n---|---  \n**v**|  Indicates the DMARC version used. Required. Set it to `v=DMARC1`.  \n**p**|  Determines how to handle messages that fail DMARC authentication. Required. The following values are available:\n* `p=none` (Monitor Mode). Emails that do not pass authentication are still delivered to the recipient's inbox. This is useful if you only want to monitor and collect data on messages that fail DMARC checks.\n* `p=quarantine` (Quarantine Mode). Depending on the recipient server, emails that fail DMARC authentication are either sent to a separate spam/quarantine folder or rejected. This lets you review and analyze potentially fraudulent emails.\n* `p=reject` (Reject Mode): Emails that fail DMARC checks are outright rejected by the recipient. This means that these messages are not delivered to the recipient's inbox, providing a higher level of protection against phishing and spoofing attacks.\nThe exact mode to use depends on your business goals. However, if you want to use a stricter mode, we recommend using less strict modes first to ensure legitimate emails are not blocked inadvertently.  \n**rua**|  Specifies the email address to send aggregate reports that let you gain insights into the authentication status of your domain's emails. Optional.  \n**ruf**|  Specifies the email address to send forensic reports. Optional.  \n## Add the necessary records to the DNS area of your domain\u200b\nTo ensure high level of domain reputation and email deliverability, add the SPF, DKIM, Tracking Domain records and the DMARC policy to the DNS-zone of the email domain settings.\nThe setup procedure is as follows:\n1. If the DNS zone of your domain does not have an SPF record yet, you need to copy the generated SPF record from the **DKIM/SPF setup instructions** area on the **Email settings** page. The record will look as follows:\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \n@| TXT| v=spf1 a mx include:_spf.elasticemail.com ~all  \n2. If you already have a TXT record with SPF information, add the following to the record:\n1. \"a mx\" right after **v=spf1**. If the record already includes these characters, skip this step.\n2. \"include:_spf.elasticemail.com\" at the end of the record before its last statement, for example, **?all** , **~all** , or **\u2013all**.\nnote\nDepending on the DNS editor, you may need to specify \"@\" and/or domain name the \"Host / Name\" field of the DNS zone. Contact your hosting provider for information on how to enter this value correctly.\n3. Specify the DKIM record in the DNS area of your domain.\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \napi._domainkey| TXT| k=rsa;t=s;p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBg QCbmGbQMzYeMvxwtNQoXN0waGYaciuKx8mtMh5czguT4EZlJX uCt6V+l56mmt3t68FEX5JJ0q4ijG71BGoFRkl87uJi7LrQt1ZZmZCvrEII 0YO4mp8sDLXC8g1aUAoi8TJgxq2MJqCaMyj5kAm3Fdy2tzftPCV /lbdiJqmBnWKjtwIDAQAB  \nnote\nCertain DNS settings may require entering \"api._domainkey.yourdomain.com\" in the \"Host / Name\" field.\n4. Specify CNAME (tracking) record in the DNS area of your domain.\nTo track the clicked link in the received email, Elastic Email overwrites the link address in the email template. When the recipient clicks to the link, the address with the domain \"api.elasticemail.com\" will be displayed in the browser first, and then the redirect to the link specified in the email will be performed. To specify your domain in the first link (for tracking), create the CNAME-record in the DNS settings of the domain:\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \ntracking| CNAME| api.elasticemail.com  \n5. Activate DMARC in the DNS area of your domain.\nDMARC verification is only added after adding SPF and DKIM records. Add a rule as TXT record of the DNS domain to activate DMARC:\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \n_dmarc| TXT| v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:user@domain.com; ruf=mailto:user@domain.com;  \nLearn more about setting up the SPF and DKIM records, DMARC policy, and the tracking domain in the official Elastic Email documentation: [How to verify your domain](https://help.elasticemail.com/en/articles/4934400-how-to-verify-your-domain).\nnote\nIt can take up to 24 hours to verify the domain. If you want to expedite the process, contact Creatio support.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Recommendations on setting up the popular DNS providers](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1977)",
