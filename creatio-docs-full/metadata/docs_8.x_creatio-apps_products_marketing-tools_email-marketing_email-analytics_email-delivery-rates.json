  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Marketing\nOn this page\nInformation about the email progress is available on the page of each email after it was sent.\n## Delivery statistics\u200b\nThe **delivery statistics chart** (Fig. 3) displays metrics for unique email responses. The data is updated every 5 minutes.\nFig. 3 Delivery statistics chart\n![Fig.\u00a03 Delivery statistics chart](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/email_analytics/scr_delivery_statistics.png)\nData on the delivery statistics chart might differ from data on the **Audience** tab. This is because Creatio receives aggregated and individual responses at a different rate.\nThe data is displayed on individual metric dashboard components. Each indicator can have either a percentage or a quantitative value. The percentages are displayed to the total number of delivered emails (the **Successful deliveries** metric).\nSuccessful deliveries| The number of delivered emails. Indicates the total number of recipients, whose mail provider response is \"Accepted by the server.\" You can display this metric in the list using the **Delivered** column.  \n---|---  \nUnique opens| The number of times emails were opened. The indicators are calculated based on opens by unique recipients. For example, if a recipient opens an email several times, the indicators will show only one \"open.\" These indicators account for cases when no information about opening the email was received from the recipient, but information about clicked links, unsubscription or flagging the email as spam exists. The metric can be displayed in the list using the **No. of opens** and **Opens, %** columns.  \nUnique clicks| The number of emails where recipients followed links in the message text and its percentage to the number of delivered emails. The indicators are calculated based on clicks by unique recipients. For example, if a recipient follows the same link in the same email multiple times, this will still count as a single click. Clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link does not count as a \"click\" in this metric. The metric can be displayed in the list using the **Number of clicks** and **Clicks, %** columns.  \nUnsubscribes| The number of unsubscribed recipients. The metric can be displayed in the list using the **No. of unsubscribes** and **Unsubscribe rate, %** columns.  \nSpam| The number of times the emails were sent to spam. Only manual spam flagging will be calculated. The metric can be displayed in the list using the **No. of spam complaints** and **Spam rate, %** columns.  \nAudience| The number of contacts added to the email audience. The widget is based on the data of the **Audience** tab.  \nStopped & cancelled| The number of emails that were not sent to the audience due to various reasons.  \nErrors| The total number of undelivered emails. The widget is based on records that received the following responses: \"Canceled,\" \"Invalid email address,\" \"Delivery error,\" \"Soft Bounce,\" \"Hard Bounce,\" \"Canceled (unsubscribed from all emails),\" \"Canceled (invalid email),\" \"Canceled (incorrect email)\" and \"Canceled (email not provided).\" The records are available on the **Audience tab**.  \nHard bounces| The number of delivery errors that have a \"Hard Bounce\" response.  \nSoft bounces| The number of delivery errors that have a \"Soft Bounce\" response.  \n## Widgets on sending and delivery errors\u200b\n### Delivery error widget\u200b\nThe **delivery error widget** (Fig. 2) on the **Bounce details** tab displays the total number of undelivered emails (those that have been sent by Creatio, but have not been delivered) grouped by delivery errors. The metric uses the information from the **Delivered errors** expanded list. Learn more: [Personal responses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1510).\nFig. 2 Delivery error widget\n![Fig.\u00a02 Delivery error widget](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/email_analytics/scr_delivery_errors.png)\n### Possible reasons of delivery errors\u200b\nSeveral factors may cause undelivered email:\n* emails may be blocked by spam filters of email providers\n* the low reputation of your email account on an email provider server\n* email sending quota set by email providers\n* outdated list of emails\nThe high \"Hard bounce\" rate indicates that your email recipient list contains many invalid email addresses. The \"Soft bounce\" response indicates temporary problems, such as \"mailbox full.\" If a large number of recipients unsubscribe from your emails, this may indicate that your recipient list is outdated. The \"Denied\" response may also mean that an email was not delivered due to technical reasons. Read more: [Personal responses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=marketing&ver=7&id=1510).\n### Sending error widget\u200b\nnote\nThe functionality is relevant to Classic UI.\nThe **sending error widget** (Fig. 1) displays the total number of undelivered emails (those that have not been sent by Creatio) grouped by sending errors. The chart uses information from the **Audience** detail and shows records that have the following responses: \"Canceled (unsubscribed from all emails),\" \"Canceled (invalid email),\" \"Canceled (incorrect email),\" \"Canceled (email not provided),\" and \"Canceled (Duplicate email).\"\nFig. 1 Sending error widget\n![Fig.\u00a01 Sending error widget](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_analyze_emails_delivery/section_email_sending_error.png)\nnote\nTo receive the \"Canceled (duplicated email) response, enable the **Prevent to send duplicated emails to recipients with the same address** system setting.
