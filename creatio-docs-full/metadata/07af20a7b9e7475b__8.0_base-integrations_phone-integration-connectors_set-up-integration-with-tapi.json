  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nFollow these steps to set up a TAPI integration with Creatio:\n1. **Set up Creatio Messaging Service**. Read more >>>\n2. **Set up the message exchange library**. Read more >>>\n3. **Set up the TAPI parameters**. Read more >>>\nThe TAPI integration requires a separate license in Creatio. You need to generate a license request, send it to our service team, upload the received license file into Creatio, and distribute licenses among users. Learn more: [Creatio licensing](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1264) and [Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1472).\nIntegration is only possible after complete preliminary TAPI driver setup by the phone integration administrator.\nImportant\nWhen setting up telephony for a Creatio production environment, deploy Creatio Messaging Service on a separate node, not on the Creatio application server. For fault tolerance, we recommend configuring at least two nodes with Creatio Messaging Service and a balancer that redirects users if connection to one node is lost.\n## 1\\. Set up Creatio Messaging Service (formerly Terrasoft Messaging Service)\u200b\nThe messaging service lets you connect Creatio to TAPI via the integration protocol and distributes call events between Creatio users.\nImportant\nInstall Creatio Messaging Service on a .NET Framework Windows server to integrate TAPI PBX.\n1. Before installing Creatio Messaging Service (CMS), **verify that your environment meets these requirements** :\n* .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later on the server where you are going to install Creatio Messaging Service\n* at least 2 Gb RAM and 20 Gb free disk space\n2. **Contact Creatio support** for the messaging service installation files or [download the archive](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/downloads/CreatioMessagingService/7.18.0.808.zip). Unpack the archive to a folder for smooth installation rather than running directly from the archive.\nImportant\nDeploy CMS on a server connected to both the Creatio application server and the PBX. Learn more: [Telephony integration basics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15775).\n3. **Run Creatio Messaging Service Install.msi** on your designated message exchange server and complete the installation. The TAPI driver must be installed and configured on the same computer by the phone integration administrator. To ensure that the TAPI driver runs correctly, use the \"Conference.exe\" utility you can receive from the support team.\n4. **Test the phone integration**.\nnote\nFollow these [instructions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2343&anchor=title-1974-14) if you need to update the Creatio Messaging Service.\n## 2\\. Set up the message exchange library\u200b\nMessage exchange library selection and setup is performed once by the system administrator.\n1. **Open the System Designer** by clicking ![btn_system_designer00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20administration/administration/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_telephony_setup/btn_system_designer00001.png) in the top right corner of the application window.\n2. **Click System settings** in the **System setup** block.\n3. **Open the \"Default messages exchange library\"** (\"SysMsgLib\" code) system setting and set its default value to \"Telephony integration library based on Tapi protocol.\"\n4. **Open the \"Message exchange server\"** (\"SysMsgServerNode\" code) system setting. Select the connection parameters of the system messages service. In the **Default value** field, specify the message exchange network address in the following format: \"ws://0.0.0.0:2013\" if your website is served over HTTP or \"wss://0.0.0.0:2013\" if your website is served over HTTPS, where:\n* \"0.0.0.0\" is IP address that your Creatio users use to access your message exchange server.\n* \"2013\" is the port used by default for connecting to the messaging service. You can change the port number in the \"**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Terrasoft Messaging Service\\Terrasoft.Messaging.Service.exe.config** \" file.\nnote\nIf your website is served over HTTPS and secure (WSS) connection is used for WebSockets, you will need to install a security certificate on the message exchange server and specify it in the configuration files of the message service. Learn more: [Configure a WSS phone service connection](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1755).\n5. **Save the changes**.\n## 3\\. Set up the TAPI parameters\u200b\nThese settings should be applied for each Creatio user who received TAPI integration license. Use the user login credentials to access the system.\n1. **Open the user profile page** by clicking the **Profile** image button on the main page of the application.\n2. **Click the Call Center parameters setup** button.\n3. On the opened page, **fill out the required values** :\n1. The **Disable Call Center integration** checkbox allows you to disable Creatio integration with the phone integration. The call button will not be displayed on the communication panel of the application.\n2. Specify the TAPI user line number in **Line** field.\nImportant\nEach user should have a unique line. We recommend against assigning the same line to multiple users as this may cause errors.\n3. _The _Enable debugging__ checkbox allows you to display troubleshooting information within the browser console. This troubleshooting information can be used when the phone integration runs into problems and the customer addresses the service team.\n4. **Save the changes**.\n5. **Refresh the browser page** to apply the changes.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Manage calls](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1027)\n[Communication panel](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15597)\n[Set up integration with Asterisk](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1368)\n[Set up integration with Avaya](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1373)\n[Set up integration with Cisco Finesse](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1369)\n[Set up integration with CallWay](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1371)",
