  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Sales Enterprise\nOn this page\nSales teams operate in an environment where expectations continue to rise. Sales reps must research accounts faster, personalize outreach at scale, prepare for increasingly complex customer conversations, and deliver accurate forecasts \u2014 often with fewer resources and higher workloads. Traditional automation tools can support isolated tasks but lack the ability to interpret context, intent, or the nuances of the sales process.\nThis article covers **Creatio's agentic sales approach** that addresses this gap.\nModern revenue operations are shifting toward a **collaborative model that blends human expertise with AI-driven agents**.\n* **Humans** contribute judgment, strategic thinking, and relationship-building.\n* **AI Agents** handle structured, repeatable, and time-consuming tasks such as summarizing information, preparing materials, and enriching data.\nThis partnership allows sellers to focus on meaningful interactions while agents manage research, preparation, inspection, and documentation activities.\n## Purpose\u200b\nThis document provides a strategic, non-technical overview of how Creatio.ai supports agent-driven sales processes. It outlines:\n* **Key scenarios** where the agentic sales approach adds value\n* **Stages of the sales cycle** where each scenario has the greatest impact\n* **Roles and teams** that benefit from deploying each agent\n* **Specific behaviors and tasks** the agent performs\n* **Underlying capabilities** that power the agent\nnote\nThis Cookbook is not a technical configuration guide. Instead, it explains how agentic scenarios function, how they complement CRM processes, and how organizations can adopt them to strengthen sales execution.\nLearn more about Creatio.ai configuration and customization in separate guide: [Creatio.ai](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/creatio-ai).\nThis Cookbook is intended for sales operations personnel, revenue operations (RevOps) teams, business analysts, and system integrators involved in designing, configuring, or maintaining sales-related processes in Creatio.\nUse this document to:\n* Identify current sales challenges and match them to relevant agentic scenarios\n* Understand how agents enhance existing CRM processes\n* Prioritize where AI can deliver the highest impact\n* Explore how Creatio's agentic capabilities evolve as sales needs grow\n## Agentic sales overview\u200b\nIn Creatio, an [AI Agent](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/glossary#ai-agent) serves as a role-specific virtual teammate equipped with the following:\n* generative AI abilities\n* predictive insights\n* CRM and external data retrieval\n* summarization and enrichment workflows\n* automated follow-up actions\n* guided next steps\nInstead of manually searching for information, drafting content, or compiling notes, sellers can delegate these tasks to agents that execute them instantly and consistently.\nThe Creatio agentic sales approach is built around **six agentic scenarios** , each supporting a distinct phase of the sales cycle:\n* **Account research**\n* **Quote generation**\n* **Meeting preparation**\n* **Territory management**\n* **Forecast and pipeline review**\n* **Field sales support**\nTogether, they form a connected multi-agent sales ecosystem that helps organizations reduce manual tasks, improve quality and speed of customer interactions, strengthen deal execution and sales velocity, and drive higher win rates at scale.\n## Composable AI architecture\u200b\nCreatio's composable AI architecture makes it possible to:\n* assemble agentic workflows using modular building blocks\n* tune behavior\n* connect additional AI Skills or third-party data sources\n* trigger agents through CRM events or user actions\n* extend Creatio functionality using no-code tools\nThis flexibility enables organizations to adopt agentic scenarios gradually, deploy them as productivity accelerators, or build toward a fully AI-supported revenue model.\nAI Agents can be deployed as out-of-the-box accelerators or extended with new [AI skills](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/resources/glossary#ai-skill) such as industry classification, predictive scoring, or intelligent summarization.\n## Key agentic sales scenarios\u200b\nScenario| Primary users| Core value  \n---|---|---  \nAccount research| SDR, AE, CS| Instant account minutes enriched with internal and external data  \nQuote generation| AE, Sales Ops| AI-assisted bundling, pricing, and proposal drafting  \nMeeting preparation| AE, CSM, Managers| Complete meeting minutes, agendas, and follow-up insights  \nForecast and pipeline| Managers, RevOps| AI-supported forecasting and risk detection  \nTerritory management| Sales Ops, Managers| Data-driven territory balancing and whitespace identification  \nField sales| Field AEs, Partner Managers| Mobile-ready insights and automated post-visit actions  \nBelow are the six core agentic scenarios that collectively support the full revenue lifecycle.\nEach scenario includes:\n* purpose\n* agent behaviors\n* AI Skills used\n* considered configuration steps\n* primary users\n* manual effort eliminated\n* manual workflow \u2192 agent-assisted workflow comparisons\n### Account research agent\u200b\n#### Purpose\u200b\nSales teams often spend excessive time gathering basic account intelligence across unconnected systems.

Identify the highest-impact pain points\u200b\nStart by mapping organizational challenges to the agentic scenarios. This clarifies where automation can remove the most manual work and deliver immediate value.\nExamples:\n* Sellers spending excessive time on account research \u2192 **Account research agent**\n* Inconsistent meeting preparation \u2192 **Meeting peparation agent**\n* Forecasting friction and manual spreadsheet work \u2192 **Forecast and pipeline agent**\nThis helps prioritize high-ROI areas for initial deployment.\n#### 2\\. Identify 1\u20132 highest-priority agents\u200b\nWe recommend deploying agentic scenarios gradually. Start by selecting 1-2 scenarios that address your most immediate operational challenges and deliver visible impact quickly.\nAnchor candidates:\n* **Account research agent** \u2014 boosts productivity for all sellers\n* **Meeting preparation agent** \u2014 immediate impact on deal quality\n* **Forecast and pipeline agent** \u2014 high value for managers and RevOps\nThese scenarios deliver fast wins and help teams adapt to agent-assisted processes.\n#### 3\\. Configure predictive AI Skills and workflows\u200b\nEach agent uses a combination of:\n* predictive scoring\n* enrichment workflows\n* summarization\n* next-best-action logic\n* historical pattern analysis\nTune these elements to align with your organization's customers, data sources, and sales workflows.\n#### 4\\. Integrate with existing CRM processes\u200b\nAgentic behaviors has to complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 your established sales processes. Ensure each agent's output flows naturally into the operational workflows your teams already use.\nExamples:\n* Outputs provided by the **Account research agent** feed SDR outreach workflows.\n* Minutes provided by the **Meeting preparation agent** integrate with calendar events and opportunities.\n* Recommendations provided by the **Forecast and pipeline agent** connect to manager coaching workflows.\n* Ensuring alignment with existing processes improves adoption.\n#### 5\\. Expand using additional skills and data sources\u200b\nCreatio's composable architecture allows teams to extend agents with:\n* third-party intent data\n* industry classification AI Skills\n* specialized summarization skills\n* enrichment sources (LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, D&B, etc.)\n* custom workflows tailored to your sales methodology\nThis enables iterative improvement without rewrites or complex development.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio.ai overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2528)\n[Creatio.ai architecture](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2548)\n[Enhance sales workflow using Creatio.ai](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2603)\n## Resources\u200b\n[Creatio.ai Foundational & Introductory](https://academy.creatio.com/e-learning/creatioai-foundational-introductory)\n[Creatio.ai Custom Skills & Agents](https://academy.creatio.com/e-learning/creatioai-custom-skills-agents)\n[Creatio.ai Pre-built CRM Agents](https://academy.creatio.com/e-learning/creatioai-pre-built-crm-agents)",
