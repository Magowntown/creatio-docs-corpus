  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nUse Creatio activities to manage your working hours, create schedules, plan activities for other employees, track interconnections between activities and other Creatio sections, and keep records of completed tasks.\nThere are several [quick filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017#title-1755-1) available in the section:\n* By date (**Start** and **Due** fields) \u2013 displays activities that overlap with the specified period. For example, if the activity period is longer than the one specified in the quick filter and these periods overlap, Creatio will display the activity.\n* By employee \u2013 displays the activity records in which the selected contact is listed as a participant. The records are filtered by data in the **Participants** detail of an activity page.\nIn Creatio, a task can be:\n* added manually.\n* received through [MS Exchange synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1421).\n* received through [Google synchronization](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1424).\n## Create an activity from the section list\u200b\nnote\nCreatio will add the contact specified in the **Owner** or **Contact** field to the **Participants** detail automatically. Copying an activity will copy the list of its participants too.\n1. Open the **Activities** section.\n2. Click the **New task** button. This will open a box.\n3. Specify the main task data in the box.\nTitle| The goal of the activity, for example, \"Prepare documents\" or \"Present an offer.\"  \n---|---  \nStart| The date and time when the activity should be started and finished. By default, the **Due** field value is set to 30 days after the **Start** field value. Use the ![timezone_symbol.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20sales/enterprise/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/specs_activities/timezone_symbol.png) icon when planning activities for participants in different time zones.  \nDue  \nStatus| Activity status. For example, \"In progress\" or \"Completed.\"  \nRole| Any user with the role will be able to complete the task.  \nOwner| The user who is responsible for completing the activity. If you specify a role on the previous step, you will be able to select only the users with the corresponding role in this field. If you leave the **Role** field empty, you will be able to specify any system user in the **Owner** field.  \nCategory| Activity category. For example, \"Meeting\" or \"Paperwork.\"  \n4. Click **Save**.\nAs a result, a new record will be added to the **Activities** section.\n5. Open the **Activities** section list. Select a record in the section list and click **Open**. This will open a new page.\n6. Provide more information about the task on the **General info** tab of the newly-opened page.\n1. Use the **Connected to** detail to add information about other Creatio objects connected to the activity.\nAccount| Company or person connected to the activity. If you select a contact, Creatio will populate the **Account** field with the company specified on the contact page.  \n---|---  \nContact  \nContract| Contract connected to the activity.  \nOpportunity| An opportunity whose part the activity is. If you select an opportunity, Creatio will populate the **Account** and **Contact** fields with the data from the fields of the selected opportunity.  \nDocument| Document connected to the activity.  \nInvoice| Invoice connected to the activity.  \nOrder| Order connected to the activity.  \nLead| A potential customer for whom you create the activity. If you select a lead, Creatio will populate the **Account** and **Contact** fields with values from the lead page.  \nProject| The project connected to the task. If you select a project, Creatio will populate the **Contact** , **Account** , and **Opportunity** fields with the data from the fields of the selected project.  \n2. Create activity reminders in the **Reminders** field group.\nRemind owner| Remind the owner and/or author about the activity at a specified time. Creatio will display the information about new reminders on the owner's and/or author's communication panel.  \n---|---  \nRemind author  \nRemind on| The date on which the activity owner or author will receive the reminder.  \n7. Specify the list of contact persons who participate in the task/call on the **Participants** tab. By default, you add a participant to the detail from the contact list, the detail will display the information from the **Job title** and **Business phone** fields of the contact page. Also, the activity will appear in the activity list of all users specified in the detail.\n8. Add more information about the task, as well as files and links to the web resources related to the activity on the **Attachments and notes** tab.\n9. Click **Save**.\n## Create a connected activity\u200b\nConnected activities let employees copy all connections from a given activity to a new one, saving your employees' time. To create a connected activity:\nFig. 1 Select the type of the connected activity\n![Fig.\u00a01 Select the type of the connected activity](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-11/scr_section_activities_create_related.png)\n1. Go to the **Activities** section.\n2. Open the record of the relevant task.\n3. Click ![btn_create_related_activity.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20sales/enterprise/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/specs_activities/btn_create_related_activity.png) on the toolbar and select the type of the activity to create (Fig. 1). This will open a new page.\n4. Specify the title and, if necessary, the start and due time on the newly-opened page.\n5. Select the **Show in calendar** checkbox to make the activity appear in the **Calendar** view of the **Activities** section.\nThis will create a new activity with all of the source activity's data about the author, owner, and connected objects. If the source activity has the **Result details** field filled out, the value of the field will be copied to the title of the connected activity. Creatio does not display the connection between the source activity and the connected activity.\n## Create an activity from the calendar\u200b\nYou can add tasks to the section directly from the calendar. To do this:\n1. Drag the cursor to highlight the period required to complete the activity (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Highlight a period in the calendar view\n![Fig.\u00a02 Highlight a period in the calendar view](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/create_activity/scr_section_activities_calendar_add_activity.png)\n2. Start typing the activity title. An activity mini page with the text you have already entered will open (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Add the task\n![Fig.\u00a03 Add the task](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/create_activity/scr_section_activities_calendar_add_activity_window_7_18.png)\n3. Enter the text, if necessary, connect the activity to other Creatio records, and save the changes.\nThis will add a new task to Creatio.\n### Edit an activity in the calendar\u200b\nTo edit an existing activity in the calendar view:\n1. Click the **title** of the needed record in the calendar area. This will open the activity mini page.\n2. Click the ![chapter_minicards_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20sales/enterprise/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/specs_activities/chapter_minicards_edit.png) button to switch the mini page to edit mode, make necessary changes, e. g., duration, status, owner, and save the mini page.\nYou can change activity duration without opening its mini page. To do this, hover over the activity border and drag the activity to the desired time mark (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Change the activity duration in the calendar view\n![Fig.\u00a04 Change the activity duration in the calendar view](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-11/scr_section_activities_calendar_change_time.png)\nDrag the activity to the desired time in the calendar view to move the activity to another date or time. If there are several activities are scheduled for the same time, they will be displayed in the calendar view within the same period.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Work with calendar](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1204)",
