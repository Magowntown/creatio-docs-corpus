  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nThe sets of sections displayed on the Creatio navigation panel for different user groups (roles) are called workplaces. You can set up any workplace by creating a list of sections that are necessary for the users in their everyday work. The sections that are not included in it will be hidden from the main Creatio menu.\nThe list of available workplaces can vary depending on the user group. For example, a **Communications** workplace can include **Activities** , **Calls** and **Feed** sections available for all system users, and a **Supervisor** workplace can include administration sections for users and roles that are available for the system administrators group only.\nAccess to the workplaces does not affect the access to Creatio objects.\nThe full set of Creatio sections the user can access in every workplace is aggregated in the **All apps** workplace. If you have both Classic UI and Freedom UI sections for a specific object, the **All apps** workplace displays only the Freeedom UI section. Manage permissions to view this workplace in the \"Can view all apps workplace\" (\"CanViewAllAppsWorkplace\" code) system operation. Creatio does not display the **All apps** workplace if the user has access to only a single workplace.\nTo access the **workplace setup** :\n1. **Open** the System Designer, e.g., by clicking ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_up_workplaces/btn_system_designer.png).\n2.

Read more >>>.\n* Edit existing workplaces. Read more >>>.\n* Set up sections in the workplace. Read more >>>.\n* Provide access permissions to the workplace for different functional and organizational user roles.
