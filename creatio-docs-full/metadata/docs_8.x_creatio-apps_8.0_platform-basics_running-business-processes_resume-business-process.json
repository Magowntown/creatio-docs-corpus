  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nIf a process step was postponed or a step was activated without opening any pages, you can resume the process in the following ways:\n* In the **Activities** section. Read more >>>\n* From a record connected to the postponed process step. Read more >>>\nLearn more about resuming business processes by a system administrator in the \"[Run a process or a process step](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7098)\" article.\n## Resume a process in the **Activities** section\u200b\nProcesses often create activities for users to complete. A list of activities is displayed in the **Activities** section and on the **History** tab in other sections.\nTo resume a process, open a connected activity in the list of the **Activities** section.\nWhen the [**User dialog**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7010) and [**Open edit page**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7012) elements are activated, a process creates activities of the \"Task\" type in the **Activities** section. If you open such an activity, the dialog page opens instead of the default activity page.\nnote\nCustom pages open only for incomplete activities. After the process element is completed, the default task page will open for this activity.\n## Resume a process from a connected record\u200b\nA process can perform steps that do not include any activities, for example, when a page must be activated during a process, or the action is connected with a specific record in the system.\nIf such a step is postponed, you can return to it by using the **Process** button on the page of the record that is connected to the step ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_28109_110)). If the record is connected to multiple tasks, you can select the required task from the list.\nFig. 1 Resuming a process from a connected record page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Resuming a process from a connected record page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_processes_execution_continue_page.png)\nIf this record is selected from a list, system also displays **Move down the process** button ([Fig. 2](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_37808_111)).\nFig. 2 Resuming a process from a list\n![Fig.\u00a02 Resuming a process from a list](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_processes_execution_continue_list.png)\nIf you click the **Move down the process** button and the record is connected to one incomplete process step, the corresponding page will be opened. If there are several steps for the record, an additional window will open where you will have the possibility to select the required step.\n## Resume a process from the communication panel\u200b\nThe notifications display case and process steps (also known as \"user actions\") that require some form of activity from you. These process-related actions may include completing Creatio activities, sending emails, editing records, filling out pre-configured pages, etc. The tab displays process tasks where:\n* You are specified as the owner.\n* The process task status is \"Running\".\nAll notifications on the ![btn_com_process_tasks00013.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_process_tasks00013.png) tab in the notification center are active until they are processed. Click the process task title to open the page where you can complete this process task ([Fig. 3](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_95995_30)).\nFig. 3 Executing a business process task\n![Fig.\u00a03 Executing a business process task](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/scr_notifications_reminder_case.png)\nPerform the process task on the opened page: complete the opened activity, send the email, save the record, etc. If the process task is canceled or postponed to a later time, the corresponding notification will be updated automatically.\nAfter completing the process task, the notification will no longer display on the communication panel. Once all process steps have been completed, the counter on the ![btn_com_process_tasks00014.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_process_tasks00014.png) button disappears.\n## Complete a process\u200b\nA process ends automatically when the end event is activated or when all active process steps are completed. When a process instance is completed, the system calculates the duration.\nnote\nOnly completed processes are taken into account when calculating statistics.\nIf you need to terminate a business process, you can [cancel the process instance](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7106) or [disable the process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7106) itself.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Run a business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7097)\n[Execute process steps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7099)",
