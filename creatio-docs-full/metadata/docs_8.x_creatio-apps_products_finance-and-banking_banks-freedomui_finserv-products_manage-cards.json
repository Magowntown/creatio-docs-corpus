  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Creatio Financial Services CRM\nOn this page\nThe **Cards** section stores information about all issued cards and their associations with bank accounts, loans, and related cards. It provides a unified workspace for financial institutions to handle customer cards alongside bank accounts, loans, and insurance policies.\nCreatio can be integrated with Core Banking Systems (CBS) and third-party platforms to automate data exchange across financial products. These integrations are not provided out of the box but can be implemented using the no-code tools of the Creatio platform. Typical integration scenarios include real-time balance updates, transaction synchronization, card issuance tracking, loan servicing updates, and insurance record maintenance.\nCard records are created automatically during the final stage of an application flow, once the corresponding product application is approved. Creatio populates the record fields using data from the application parameters.\n## Card profile\u200b\nField| Description  \n---|---  \nStatus| Current status of the card, for example, \"Active,\" \"Issued,\" \"Closed.\"  \nMasked number| The card number in masked format, for example, **** **** **** 1111.
