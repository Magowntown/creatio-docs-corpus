  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nUse the following tools to run a Creatio process manually:\n* Command line. Read more >>>\n* Side panel. Read more >>>\n* Any section that has processes associated with it. Read more >>>\n* Section record page. Read more >>>\nLearn more about how system administrators can run business processes in a separate article: [Run a process or a process step](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7098).\nnote\nRegardless of the tool, you can only run business processes that can be launched manually, provided you have the corresponding permissions. Learn more in a separate article: [Set up the permissions to run a process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2348).\nOnce a business process is run, Creatio adds a new **process instance** that starts executing process steps. These steps can include include opening record pages, creating activities, etc.\nCreatio terminates the business process instance when the end event is triggered on the process diagram. You can start and stop business processes manually or have them start automatically.\nImportant\nYou can run only active published processes with the \"Business Process\" tag manually. Processes of other types cannot be run manually. If you try to run an unpublished or inactive process, Creatio displays an error message.\n## Run a process from the command line\u200b\n1. Enter **Run process** followed by the process name in the command line (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Run a process from the command line\n![Fig.\u00a01 Run a process from the command line](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_processes_execution_start_command_line.png)\n2. Click the ![btn_param_window_change.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/btn_param_window_change.png) button.\nnote\nLearn more about the command line functionality in a separate article: [Search records and run commands](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1228).\n## Run a process from the side panel\u200b\n1. Click the ![btn_com_sidebar_start_process.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/btn_com_sidebar_start_process.png) button on the side panel.\n2. Select a process to run (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Run a process from the side panel using the run process button\n![Fig.\u00a02 Run a process from the side panel using the run process button](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_process_execution_start_process_sidebar.png)\nnote\nSpecify whether you can run the process using the ![btn_com_sidebar_start_process00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/btn_com_sidebar_start_process00001.png) button on the [process properties page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7111) of the **Process library** section.\nTo run a process that is unavailable in the ![btn_com_sidebar_start_process00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/btn_com_sidebar_start_process00002.png) button index:\n1. Select **Another process** (Fig. 3). This opens a box.\nFig. 3 Select the command that runs a process\n![Fig.\u00a03 Select the command that runs a process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_process_execution_start_other_process.png)\n2. Select a process in the box that opens and click **Run**.\nnote\nThe same box opens when you click the ![btn_com_main_menu.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/btn_com_main_menu.png) button in the side panel and select **Run process**.\n## Run a process from a section or record page\u200b\nIf a section has an index of processes you can run from the section set up, Creatio displays the **Run process** button in the section toolbar.\nTo run a process from a section:\n1. Click **New process**.\n2. Select a process to run (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Run a process from a section\n![Fig.\u00a04 Run a process from a section](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_processes_execution_start_section.png)\nCreatio displays the same process index on the record page when you click **Process** on the toolbar (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Run a process from a record page\n![Fig.\u00a05 Run a process from a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_execution/scr_chapter_processes_execution_start_page.png)\n### Run a process for multiple records in a section\u200b\nYou can run a [section business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7152) for multiple records at once. To do this:\n1. Open the section where you want to run a process for multiple records, e. g., **Contacts**.\n2. Click **Actions** \u2192 **Select multiple records**.\n3. Select the needed records.\n4. Click **Run process** on the section toolbar and select the needed process.\nnote\nThe **Run process** button menu displays all processes you can run from the section. The processes in the menu are grouped by start type: from the section and from a record.\nFig. 6 Run a process for multiple section records\n![Fig.\u00a06 Run a process for multiple section records](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/run_business_process/run_process_multiple_records_0.gif)\nAs a result, Creatio will run a separate process instance for every selected record. If one of the instances fails, other instances will continue running.\n## Run a process automatically\u200b\nProcesses can be run automatically when certain events occur. These events include adding, modifying and deleting records. In this case, you do not need to run the process manually.\nSet up the automatic process start after an event in the [Process Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7172).\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Execute process steps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7099)\n[Resume a business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7105)\n[Run a process or a process step](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7098)",
