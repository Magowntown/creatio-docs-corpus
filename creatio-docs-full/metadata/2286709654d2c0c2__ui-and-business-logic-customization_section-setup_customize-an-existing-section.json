These tools will be deprecated in future releases. We recommend using the modern Freedom UI tools that provide a more flexible and future-ready experience. Learn more: [Overview of Freedom UI Designer and its elements](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376&ver=8.0).\nImportant\nSome of the sections can only be edited by developer means. The Section Wizard is unavailable in any sections designed for configuring the Creatio application (these are sections that are available in the **Studio** workplace or the System Designer, such as the **Process library** , **System settings** , **Lookups** , etc.); as well as non-standard sections, such as **Agent desktop** , **Queues** , **Forecasts** , **Marketing plans** , **Dashboards** , etc. Non-standard sections, usually, have their specific customization tools.\nTo customize and existing section:\n1.
