You will be able to update the account details at any moment.\nWhen you save an account, a [duplicate search](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1591) page might open. It means that this record might already exist in Creatio. You can edit the new record or indicate that the records found are not duplicates of the newly saved record.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a contact](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1002)",
