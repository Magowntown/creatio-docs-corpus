Email attachments will be added automatically.\nnote\nYou can set up periodic synchronization of the email account using the [email account individual settings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1918) page.\nEach time an email is downloaded, Creatio automatically performs initial email processing:\n* The **From** field value is associated with the communication options of contacts and accounts registered in Creatio. If the match is found, the **Account** and **Contact** fields on the email page are populated automatically.\n* If no match is found, Creatio analyzes the values in the **To** , **Cc** , and **Bcc** fields. Then, if the match is found, the **Account** and **Contact** fields on the email page are populated automatically.\nnote\nWhen matching the **To** , **Cc** , and **Bcc** fields with contact communication options, any contacts connected to Creatio user records will be ignored.\n* Creatio also verifies the **rules for binding emails to other Creatio objects**. Read more >>>\nAs a result, the user who loaded the email will be specified as the record's author and owner.\n## Process emails\u200b\nAn email is considered **processed** if both is true:\n* The **Account** or **Contact** is specified.\n* At least one of the connection fields, for example, **Opportunity** or **Contract** , is filled out.\nnote\nEmails in which the **Contact** , **Account** , and **Case** fields were automatically populated are not processed.\nWhen uploaded, the emails are processed **automatically** according to the email binding rules.\nnote\nAn email is considered processed if the **Needs processing** checkbox on the email page is cleared. The checkbox is selected/cleared automatically.\nThe emails that were not processed automatically require **manual** processing.\n1. Select the **Not processed** filter to **display the unprocessed emails**. (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Filter emails\n![Fig.\u00a06 Filter emails](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_emails/scr_emails_act_uncultivated_email.png)\n2. **Select the email** to process (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 Select an unprocessed email\n![Fig.\u00a07 Select an unprocessed email](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_emails/chapter_emails_connect_existing_2.png)\n3. **Bind an email** to Creatio records. Learn more about the manual binding of emails to Creatio records: Link emails to existing records.\n4. **Click** **Mark as processed**. If the email that you processed is part of an email thread, Creatio will offer to process all emails in the thread.\nAs a result, this email or email thread will no longer be displayed in the list of unprocessed emails and the **Needs processing** checkbox on its page will be cleared. To view the list of processed emails, select the **Processed** filter in the filter area.\n## Add records based on emails\u200b\nYou can create a new record in any Creatio section based on an email from the communication panel. For example, add a new contact based on an email from an unknown sender. Their email address and name will be automatically populated on their edit page using the data from the linked email. If you add another record (i. e., an opportunity, invoice, or an order), Creatio automatically populates its corresponding fields on the contact page with the corresponding data from the email. For example, when you create a new opportunity, the **Customer** field on the opportunity page contains the name of the account or contact.\nTo create a new contact record based on an incoming email:\n1. Click the ![icn_communitaction_panel.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/icn_communication_panel.png) button to **open the communication panel**.\n2. **Click** the ![icn_email.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/icn_email.png) button in the communication panel.\n3. **Select an email**.\n4. **Click** the ![btn_com_add_tab.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_emails/btn_com_add_tab.png) button in the top right corner of the email \u2192 **Add new** (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Add a new record based on an email in the communication panel\n![Fig.\u00a08 Add a new record based on an email in the communication panel](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_emails/chapter_emails_create_new.png)\n5. **Select an object** (the type of Creatio record to create) from the menu, for example, \u201cContact\u201d (Fig. 9). This creates a new contact edit page whose **Name** and **Email** fields are populated using the email data.\nFig. 9 Select the type of Creatio record to add\n![Fig.\u00a09 Select the type of Creatio record to add](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/scr_select_new_object.png)\n6. **Modify the entered data** manually before saving the changes if needed (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 The page of the contact created from the email\n![Fig.\u00a010 The page of the contact created from the email](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/scr_new_contact_page.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will add a new record based on the email data to the **Contacts** section.\n## Link emails to existing records\u200b\nYou can bind emails to other records manually:\n* by using a special email field where you can specify a Creatio record to bind (Fig. 11)\nFig. 11 Bind an email to another record using email fields\n![Fig.\u00a011 Bind an email to another record using email fields](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_emails/chapter_emails_connect_existing_200007.png)\n* by clicking the ![btn_com_add_tab00008.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_emails/btn_com_add_tab00008.png) button in the top right corner of the email (Fig. 12)\nFig. 12 Bind an email to another record using the + button\n![Fig.\u00a012 Bind an email to another record using the + button](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/scr_link_email.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will display the bound email in the **History** tab of the activity page.\n## Auto-link emails to existing records\u200b\nTo bind an incoming or outgoing email to other Creatio objects, set up the binding rules in the **Rules for connecting emails to system sections** lookup. For example, if the email subject contains an invoice number, the email will be automatically bound to the corresponding Creatio invoice.\nTo set up the binding rules:\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/btn_system_designer.png) to **open the System Designer**.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 **Lookups**.\n3. **Open** the **Rules for connecting emails to system sections** lookup.\n4. **Click** the **Add rule** button or **open an existing rule** for editing on the lookup page.\n5. **Fill out the required fields** (Fig. 13) on the displayed page:\nFig. 13 Set up the binding rules\n![Fig.\u00a013 Set up the binding rules](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/work_with_emails/scr_lookup_rule.png)\n1. Specify the rule name, for example, \u201cEmail subject with invoice number.\u201d\n2. Enter a regular expression that matches the subject text in the **Rule** field, such as the invoice number prefix.\nFor example, if the following invoice auto numbering format is set up as follows: Inv-1, Inv-2, Inv-3, ..., Inv-n, the regular expression is Inv-[0-9]+. As a result, when the following email is received - \u201cAdditional information for Inv-53,\u201d Creatio will automatically verify whether the specified invoice exists. If the invoice is found, the **Invoice** field on the email page will be populated with the corresponding value.\nnote\nTo ensure the right connection between emails and other Creatio objects, configure different auto numbering patterns for different system objects. For example, the auto numbering pattern is \u201cInv-0\u201d for invoices, \u201cOrd-0\u201d for orders, \u201cCont-0\u201d for contacts, etc. Set up the [record auto numbering](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=269) in Creatio via the system settings.\n3. Fill out the **Object for connection** field group. To automatically bind emails to Creatio objects, select \u201cActivity\u201d in the **Object** field. In the **Column** field, specify the field to bind. Creatio performs the match search using the email subject. It is located in the **Subject** column.\n4. Fill out the **Connected object** fields group. In the **Object** field, select the Creatio object for which the rule is set up, for example, \u201cInvoice.\u201d In the **Column** field, select the column to perform the match search. In this case, the column is **Number**.\n6. **Save the rule**.\n7. **Add the rules for other sections** in a similar way.\nAs a result, when uploading messages to Creatio and sending emails from Creatio, the message subjects will be checked according to the configured rules. If the match is found, the connection fields will be automatically populated. In addition, such messages will be automatically considered processed.\n## Working with emails FAQ\u200b\n#### Why do I receive an email notification that the login/password is incorrect after mailbox registration?\u200b\nEmail server security settings sometimes block access to mailboxes from third-party applications. If you entered the information correctly during the email account registration, but still received a notification about an incorrect username or password, do the following:\n1. Enable IMAP access in the mailbox settings. Usually, email forwarding and POP/IMAP protocol management settings are in a separate group.\n2. Enable access to your email account from third-party applications in the email account security settings.\n3. In most cases, the email server sends the users an email about an attempt to connect to the mailbox. Confirm the connection authenticity by following a special link from the email.\n4. Repeat the mailbox registration procedure.\n#### How do I set up a custom email provider?\u200b\nnote\nSet up the [Email Listener](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2074) synchronization service before setting up an email provider.\nTo set up email provider integration, open ports 25 and 587 on the Creatio application server. On the email provider selection page, click the **Add provider** button, select the provider type and fill out the send/receive settings. Learn more about the detailed procedures for email provider setup in separate articles: [Add IMAP/SMTP email provider](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1415). [Microsoft Exchange / Microsoft 365 email, contacts, and calendar](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/ms-exchange--microsoft-365-email-and-calendar).\n#### Why no emails can be received in Creatio after a successful mailbox synchronization setup?\u200b\nThis can occur if one of the following is the case:\n1. The \u201cActivity\u201d object includes a custom field required on the application level.\nTo ensure Creatio receives emails properly, modify the field attributes. Make it required on the page level, but not required in the object.\n2. The emails received from an IMAP mail server have been downloaded to Creatio and then deleted, or they have been downloaded to any other email client earlier.\nTo upload the email to Creatio, change the name of the lookup based on the \u201cEmailSynchronizedKey\u201d object to an arbitrary name.\n#### How to set up a shared mailbox?\u200b\nShared email accounts are used for email communication between the support team and users. [Shared mailbox](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1867) setup is similar to individual mailbox setup in general, but has a number of additional steps.\n#### Why are the outgoing emails not imported to Creatio?\u200b\nYou can set up the import of all emails from your mailbox to Creatio. Alternatively, you can import emails from specific mailbox folders only. Check your email account folder settings for email import.\nIf your mailbox security settings restrict access to certain mailbox folders for third-party applications, these folders will be unavailable for importing into Creatio. To permit access to these folders for third-party applications, modify your mailbox security settings.\nAlso, in some cases, outgoing emails might not be imported from Microsoft Outlook, because not all email servers support saving emails sent from third-party applications.\n#### Why do I receive the \u201cError sending email, please contact system administrator\u201d message when trying to send emails?\u200b\nThis error might be the result of the following:\n* sending emails is restricted on the provider level\n* no connection to SMTP server\n* one of the following ports is closed on the SMTP server: 25, 465, 587\nContact your system administrator to determine the exact cause of the error and correct it.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Add IMAP/SMTP email provider](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1415)\n[Set up the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft 365 services](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1254)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Email marketing](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531266/takecourse)",
