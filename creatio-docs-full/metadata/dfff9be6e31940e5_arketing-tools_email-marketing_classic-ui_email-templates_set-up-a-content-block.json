  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Marketing\nOn this page\nnote\nThe functionality is relevant to Classic UI.\nContent block elements arrange other elements of a template. You need at least one block in your template to be able to add non-block elements. Blocks cannot contain other blocks.\nFig. 1 Sample template layout\n![Fig.\u00a01 Sample template layout](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_template_empty_callouts.png)\nA block has a table-like layout. Blocks can hold two types of rows:\n* **Sections** are multi-column rows. A section can have up to 6 columns. Use sections to arrange most types of content. They are also preferable in general because of their flexibility.\n* **Banners** are single-column rows. Use banners to insert images that will fill all available space and fit inside the element regardless of the image size. You can align the background image of a banner vertically and horizontally.\nAs an alternative to using banners, you can specify a background image of an entire block. However, this background image will not stretch or shrink to fit the borders of the block.\nBy default, a block has one section and no banners. A block must have at least one section or banner. It is not possible to delete the only section or banner of a block.\nYou can add multiple sections to a single block or add multiple blocks. There will be no visible differentce for the email recipients. We recommend adding any reusable content as separate blocks and saving them to the Block Library for later.\n## Create a content block\u200b\nTo add a block to a template, drag the **Block** (![content_builder_block_view_model_icon.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/content_builder_block_view_model_icon.png)) element from the element grid to the working area (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Using the Content Designer\n![Fig.\u00a01 Using the Content Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/block_use_case.gif)\nThere are several ways you can select a block in the working area:\n* Click on the right border of the block (Fig. 2).\n* Click any element inside the section or banner, then press **Esc** to go up the navigation tree until the **Block** element is selected.\n* Click any element inside the section or banner, then click \"Block\" in the breadcrumb navigation in the setup area. Click the leftmost element if \"Block\" is not yet visible (Fig. 3).\nFig. 2 Selecting the block by clicking on the right border\n![Fig.\u00a02 Selecting the block by clicking on the right border](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/selecting_block_by_three_dots_cropped.gif)\nFig. 3 Selecting the block by using the setup area\n![Fig.\u00a03 Selecting the block by using the setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/selecting_block_by_breadcrumbs_cropped.gif)\nWhen a block element is selected, its context menu appears on the right (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Block context menu\n![Fig.\u00a04 Block context menu](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_block_context_menu.png)\n* ![scr_block_context_menu_move_icon.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_block_context_menu_move_icon.png): change block position. Drag the block up or down to reorder the blocks in the template.\n* ![scr_block_context_menu_copy_icon.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_block_context_menu_copy_icon.png): copy the block. A copy block will appear directly under the original block.\n* ![scr_block_context_menu_remove_icon.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_block_context_menu_remove_icon.png): remove the block from the template. This will permanently remove any blocks that have not been saved in the block library. Deleting a block from the template will not delete it from the block library.\n* ![scr_block_context_menu_save_icon.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_block_context_menu_save_icon.png): save the block in the Block Library. Creatio will prompt you to enter the name under which the block will be saved.\n## Set up a content block\u200b\nUse the setup area on the right to configure the **Block** element.\nThe setup area comprises of three tabs:\n* **Structure**. The default tab available in the Campaign Designer and Process Designer. It is the only tab available when you open the Content Designer from the Process Designer.\n* **Dynamic Content**. This tab is only available in the marketing Content Designer for Creatio Marketing. Use it to set up different variations of a block for different conditions, configured on the **Rules** tab.\n* **Rules**. This tab is only available in the marketing Content Designer for Creatio Marketing. Use it to set up rules that can be used for defining dynamic content.\nThe **Structure** tab (Fig. 5) includes the following properties:\nFig. 5 Block setup area\n![Fig.\u00a05 Block setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_content_designer_block_setup_area_steps.png)\nnote\nTabs other than the **Structure** tabs are only available in Creatio Marketing and Creatio CRM bundle.\nProperty| Functionality  \n---|---  \nBreadcrumb navigation| Use breadcrumbs (1) at the top of the setup area to navigate the parent (column, section, banner, block, and template) elements.  \nSection constructor| Add, remove, and move the sections and banners of the block.To access the setup area of a section or banner, click the corresponding item in the section list. Click **Add section** or **Add banner** to add sections and banners.Click ![content_section_item_view_model_remove_icon.png](https://academy.creatio.com//sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/content_section_item_view_model_remove_icon.png) to remove a section or banner. Note that you cannot delete the last section (banner) from a content block.  \nBackground| Set background image and/or color for the entire block. Note that sections and banners can have their own background settings that may cover the background of the block.Background style settings are disabled by default. Select the checkbox (2) to enable them. Clear this checkbox to disable all background settings of the current block.Click ![content_designer_background_color.png](https://academy.creatio.com//sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/content_designer_background_color.png) to open the color picker and select the background color.Click ![icn_content_designer_background_image.png](https://academy.creatio.com//sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/icn_content_designer_background_image.png) and enter the URL of the image to display on the background.If the recipient\u2019s email client fails to load the image, the recipient will see the background color instead.  \n## Banners\u200b\nA banner is a single-column block \"row\". The main purpose of the banner element is to display a background image and some content over it (Fig. 6). Unlike the **Block** element, you can align the banner background image.\nFig. 6 Adding a banner\n![Fig.\u00a06 Adding a banner](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/banner_use_case.gif)\nA banner has a fixed height. If it is set to a value that is too large, the banner might not fit the display vertically (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 600 px vs. 320 px banner\n![Fig.\u00a07 600 px vs. 320 px banner](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_banner_600px_vs_320px_on_mobile.png)\nThe **Banner** setup area comprises of the following setup groups: **Size, px** , **Vertical align** , **Padding, px** , and **Background** (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Banner setup area\n![Fig.\u00a08 Banner setup area](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_banner_setup_area.png)\nProperty| Functionality  \n---|---  \nBreadcrumb navigation| Use breadcrumbs at the top of the setup area to navigate the parent (column, section, banner, block, and template) elements.  \nSize, px| Configure the height of the banner by specifying the **Height** field value.

You cannot delete the only column.Select the **Equalize** checkbox to ensure that all of the columns have equivalent width. If you add or remove a column when this checkbox is selected, the widths of all columns will be adjusted to match each other.Select the **Reverse the order of columns on mobile** checkbox to reverse the order of ungrouped columns and column groups on mobile devices. As a result, the last column or column group will be at the top of the section, and the first column or column group at the bottom. This does not affect columns displayed side-by-side on mobile, i. e., columns inside column groups.  \nPadding, px| Specify the distance (in pixels) between the content of the section and each of its borders. Padding is specified separately for each side.  \nCorner radius, px| Specify the circular radius of the corners of the section. Leave this property empty for sharp corners.

Instead, they are re-arranged vertically (Fig. 14).\nFig. 14 Mobile layout of a section with 6 columns\n![Fig.\u00a014 Mobile layout of a section with 6 columns](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/6_columns_mobile_layout.png)\nYou can force columns to display side by side on mobile by grouping them. A column group is a sequence of columns displayed side-by-side on mobile.\nTo group two adjacent columns:\n1. Select the **Section** element using the **Section constructor** of a **Block** element or the breadcrumbs navigation of a column or its child elements. ![btn_link_content_designer_inactive.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/btn_link_content_designer_inactive.png) buttons will appear between columns (Fig. 15).\nFig. 15 Link columns\n![Fig.\u00a015 Link columns](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_section_link_columns.png)\n2.

If both columns are parts of their respective column groups, both column groups will become one column group.\nOn mobile, grouped columns display side by side. Use the **Preview** tab at the top of the page to view how your email template displays on mobile.\nYou can also reverse the order of columns on mobile so that the last column is displayed at the top of the section and the first at the bottom. For example, if you have a two-column header with a logo on the right and a title on the left, a mobile device will normally display the title first and the logo second. However, if the order of columns is reversed, the logo will display on top.\nTo reverse the order of ungrouped columns and column groups on mobile devices, select the **Reverse the order of columns on mobile** checkbox (Fig. 16).\nFig. 16 Reverse on mobile\n![Fig.\u00a016 Reverse on mobile](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_reverse_on_mobile.png)\nFig. 17 Working with columns\n![Fig.\u00a017 Working with columns](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/mobile_use_case_slow.gif)\nAs a result, the last column or column group will be at the top of the section, and the first column or column group at the bottom.\nFig. 18 Normal column order vs. reverse column order\n![Fig.\u00a018 Normal column order vs. reverse column order](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_block/scr_normal_vs_reverse_column_order.png)\nnote\nThis does not affect columns displayed side-by-side on mobile, i. e., columns inside column groups.\n## Anchors\u200b\nThe Content Designer lets you use anchors.
