  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nCreatio.ai is natively embedded AI functionality in the core of the Creatio Freedom UI platform, designed to empower organizations with intelligent automation by acting as a virtual agent assistant to the end user performing tasks. Creatio.ai's unified AI approach brings together predictive, generative, and agentic AI to deliver a comprehensive solution for modern business automation.\n* Predictive AI helps users make informed decisions by providing recommendations based on data analysis. For example, Creatio.ai can suggest the next best actions for a sales opportunity based on historical data and engagement patterns.\n* Generative AI creates content or responses automatically, such as generating personalized emails, meeting summaries, or marketing copy tailored to specific customer segments.\n* Agentic AI autonomously executes tasks on behalf of the user, such as scheduling follow-up meetings or updating records in the CRM based on predefined triggers and conditions.\n## AI Agents\u200b\nAI Agents are independent entities that operate within Creatio.ai and help automate complex user tasks. The task performed by an agent depends on its complexity, for example, creating email campaigns, and its area of competence, for example, service or sales support.\nLearn more about agents here: [Introduction to AI Agents](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2593).\n## AI Command Center\u200b\n**AI Skills** are the specific capabilities within Creatio.ai that enable intelligent automation, ranging from data analysis and content generation to workflow execution. These Skills can be easily configured, customized, and extended to address a wide variety of business scenarios.\nThe **AI Command Center** provides centralized tools for managing all AI capabilities within Creatio, allowing users to monitor, configure, and optimize AI-driven workflows from a single interface. It enables real-time visibility into the performance and usage of various AI Skills, ensuring that organizations can easily adapt AI processes to meet evolving business needs.\nFig. 2 Creatio.ai skills\n![Fig. 2 Creatio.ai skills](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/copilot_overview/scr_ai_command_center.png)\n## Out-of-the-Box AI Skills\u200b\nCreatio.ai comes with a set of pre-configured AI Skills that let you get started with intelligent automation right away. Learn more about the out-of-the-box AI Skills: [AI Skill list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2549).\n## Creatio.ai User Experience\u200b\nCreatio.ai user experience panel is always available to the user to support their daily tasks and workflows. Creatio.ai ensures that end users can quickly leverage advanced AI to drive efficiency and productivity, freeing up their time from repetitive tasks to focus on more value-added work.\nFig. 3 Creatio.ai\n![Fig. 3 Creatio.ai](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/copilot_overview/scr_creatio_ai.png)\nCreatio.ai redefines user interaction with Creatio Freedom UI, shifting the focus from how to what needs to be achieved. It empowers users to do the following:\n* **Perform System Actions** : Execute system actions within Creatio with ease, streamlining tasks and reducing manual effort.\n* **Get Data-Driven Answers** : Receive comprehensive and accurate answers to questions based on the rich data within the Creatio platform.\n* **Automate AI-Powered Tasks** : Automate repetitive tasks, such as generating descriptions, freeing up valuable time for more strategic endeavors.\n* **Elevate Productivity** : Focus on higher-level tasks and strategic thinking while Creatio.ai handles the mundane, boosting overall productivity.\n* **Tackle Complex Challenges** : Leverage the power of generative AI and user-defined rules to tackle complex tasks with confidence.\nCreatio.ai empowers users to achieve their goals without writing complex code. Its intuitive no-code interface enables users to describe desired outcomes using simple language, making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.\nTo access Creatio.ai, click ![btn_ai.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCode_Customization/copilot_overview/btn_ai.png) in the top right. You can interact with it using simple language. For example, ask it to translate text or provide an overview of a record page. Creatio.ai also includes advanced customizable functions called AI Skills. Use AI Skills or Agents to enable users to perform a complex task as a single prompt without the need to do everything step by step. Learn more: [Develop Creatio.ai Skill](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2535), [AI Skill development recommendations](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2536).\nCreatio.ai is available as part of all versions of the platform, at no additional cost. Creatio.ai\u2019s use of AI Skills is based upon package plans that include AI Actions. AI Action is a completed interaction with the large language model (LLM) that works similarly to an API call. A single user request in Creatio.ai chat can take more than one AI Action.\nYou can use Creatio.ai in any language, but we recommend using English.\n## Creatio.ai models\u200b\nYou can fine-tune performance of AI Agents and AI Skills by selecting which large language model (LLM) they use to process requests. The Creatio-hosted models have the following advantages:\n* **GPT-5** : best for complex, high-stakes tasks that need deep reasoning and strict instruction following. Use for multi-step planning, policy or legal summarization, advanced data extraction that uses constraints, long-context analysis.\n* **GPT-4.1** : strong general-purpose choice when you want a balance of quality, speed, and cost. Use for most skills and agents, content drafting, and accurate structured outputs.\n* **GPT-4o** : optimized for multimodal and real-time interactions. Use when you need fast, natural, and responsive conversations.\n* **GPT-4.1 mini** : fastest and most cost-effective. Use for intent detection, routing, short summaries, simple transformations, classification, template filling, and high-throughput batch tasks.\nIf you do not specify any model, Creatio.ai uses GPT-4.1.\n## Creatio.ai prerequisites\u200b\nCreatio.ai does not involve training, retraining, or fine-tuning any LLMs. As such, it does not have specific data requirements. For Creatio.ai to be able to work with data, it must exist in Creatio or Creatio must have access to it via a web API. We recommend not using HTML tags in text data so that Creatio.ai can work faster.\nCreatio.ai requires Freedom UI to be turned on. Creatio.ai only works with context of Freedom UI pages.\nCreatio.ai does not work with graphics, widgets, and dashboards.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio.ai architecture](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2548)\n[Develop Creatio.ai Skill](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2535)\n[AI Skill development recommendations](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2536)\n[AI Skill list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2549)\n[Creatio.ai system actions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2550)\n[Data privacy in Creatio.ai](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2529)\n[Creatio.ai skill and agent permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2625)\n[Creatio AI (developer documentation)](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/category/creatio-ai)",
