  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nA **detail** is a page element that displays records of an object linked to the current record. Use details to display data from another object that is connected to the current record. For example, a contact\u2019s noteworthy events or an account\u2019s addresses. The majority of details come with their own record list. The detail only displays entries connected to the current section record. The connection is usually established via the record page object (most often the section object) selected in the detail\u2019s lookup field. Use developer tools to create details with editable fields or custom data, such as **Attachments** , as well as details not directly connected to the current record. Learn more in the development guide: [Detail](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15571). Learn more about objects in the [Creatio object model](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531086/takecourse) course.\nnote\nSince Creatio 8.3.1, Section and Detail Wizards for Classic UI are no longer available for creating new sections and details. These tools will be deprecated in future releases. We recommend using the modern Freedom UI tools that provide a more flexible and future-ready experience. Learn more: [Overview of Freedom UI Designer and its elements](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376&ver=8.0).\nFor example, the **Activity participants** detail shows the participant list of the current activity. The **Activities** detail (Fig. 1) shows the list of activities linked to the current account, contact, etc.\nFig. 1 Record filtering on the Activities detail\n![Fig.\u00a01 Record filtering on the Activities detail](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_record_filtering_on_activities_detail.png)\nYou can create a detail in the Section wizard during the page setup or use the Detail wizard. Creatio adds details created in the Section wizard to the relevant section page automatically. You have to add details created in the Detail wizard to the section page manually. Learn more: [Add an existing detail on a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2030)\nYou can create a detail:\n* Based on an **existing** object. For example, display new custom section\u2019s data as a detail in other sections. You can also use this option to add multiple unique details created from the same object to section pages. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2032&anchor=title-150-1)\n* Using a **new** object. For example, display the list of medical documents for employees\u2019 sick leave applications in the custom **Requests** section. Use this option when the object whose data you would like to use does not exist yet. [Read more >>>](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2032&anchor=title-150-2)\nAll objects and schemas created in the Section or Detail wizard are bound to a specific package. If you plan to transfer changes between environments, create a user-made package before creating the detail. Then, set this package as the new destination for custom objects. \n## Add a detail based on an existing object\u200b\nYou can use Creatio sections or lookups to create a detail. To ensure the transferability of new packages, check the package bindings before starting the setup:\n* When creating a detail based on a **custom** object, make sure that your current changes are saved to the same or dependent package.\n* When creating a detail based on a **base** object, make sure that your current package is dependent on the package with the base object (usually the Base package or a product functionality package, such as \"SalesEnterprise\").\nLearn more about packages in the [Get started with packages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15121) developer documentation article.\nExample\nCreate a detail that will display a list of the contact\u2019s requests on their page.\nThis example will create a detail from an object of a custom **Requests** section. Learn more about adding custom sections in the [Create a new section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1397) article.\n1. Open a section, e. g., **Contacts**.\n2. Click **View** \u2192 **Open Section Wizard**.\n3. In the **Section pages** block of the Section Wizard:\n* click **Edit page** if you have only one edit page in the section\n* click **the link to the relevant page** if there are several pages in the section.\n4. Navigate to the tab where you would like to place the detail.\n5. Click **New detail**.\n6. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/images/NoCode_Customization/section_wizard/btn_add.png) button to the right of the **Detail** field in the detail setup window.\n7. Select **Add based on existing object** in the menu that pops up (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Adding a detail based on an existing object\n![Fig.\u00a02 Adding a detail based on an existing object](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_create_detail_from_section_wizard.png)\n8. In the pop-up window (Fig. 3):\n1. Specify which **object\u2019s** data the detail will use. In our case, it is \"**Requests**.\"\n2. Specify the detail **title** that will help you find it in the object list. In our case, it is \"**Contact requests**.\"\n3. Add **translations** for the title if necessary. Learn more about translations in the following article: [Add new element translations](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2350).\n4. Select the **Make the list editable** checkbox to make the detail\u2019s data editable directly from the list without the need to open a new page.\n5. Click **Save**.\nFig. 3 Setting up a detail based on an existing object in the Section wizard\n![Fig.\u00a03 Setting up a detail based on an existing object in the Section wizard](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_set_detail_from_existing_object_in_section_wizard.png)\n9. Set up how the detail will display the records of the **Requests** section in the **What records to show on the page?** block:\n1. The **Where detail column** field specifies the detail object\u2019s column the value of which Creatio will use to check whether to display the record. In our case, it is the \"**Created by** \" column.\n2. The **Equals to page column** field specifies the current section\u2019s page column the value of which Creatio will compare to the value of the column specified in the **Where detail column** field. In our case, it is the \"**Id** \" column.\nAs a result, the contact page will only display those records of the **Requests** section where the **Created by** field matches the specified contact.\n10. Click **Save**.\n11. Save the changes in the window and in the Section Wizard.\nAs a result, a new schema and detail page will be available. Creatio will register the new detail and add it to the record page. The detail\u2019s edit page is identical to the page from the custom **Requests** section. All changes made on the detail page will also be available on the section page. The new detail\u2019s schema (the client module) and data will be available in the package to which the changes are saved. The **Contacts** section\u2019s updated object, schema, and an edit page will also be available in the package.\nYou can also implement this example in the Detail wizard. As a result, Creatio will register a new detail and display it in the detail list in the section wizard. You will be able to add the detail to section pages. Learn more: [Create a detail to add it to a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2142&anchor=title-150-3) The new detail\u2019s schema (the client module) and data will be available in the package to which the changes are saved.\n## Add a detail based on a new object\u200b\nExample\nCreate a new detail for medical documents in the **Requests** custom section.

Specify the following in the pop-up (Fig. 5):\n1. The **object title** in the configuration object list. In our case, it is \"**Medical documents**.\"\n2. The **detail title** to help you find the detail in the Section wizard\u2019s object list. In our case, it is \"**Medical documents**.\"\n3. A unique **code** that displays in the configuration object list. The code must contain a prefix that identifies the creator of the object. The prefix is specified in the \"Prefix for object name\" system setting. In our case, the code is \"**UsrMedicalDocuments**.\"\n4. Select the **Make the list editable** checkbox to make the detail\u2019s data editable directly from the list without the need to open a new page.\n5. Creatio will populate the data in the **How to connect detail to current page?** block automatically.\n6. Click **Save**.\nFig. 5 Filling out a new detail\u2019s parameters\n![Fig.\u00a05 Filling out a new detail\u2019s parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_add_new_detail_from_section_wizard.png)\n9. Creatio will populate all parameters in the detail setup window automatically. Click **Save**.\n10. Save the changes in the window and in the Section Wizard.\nAs a result, a new object, schema, and detail page will be available. Creatio will register the new detail and add it to the page of the custom **Requests** section.\nThe detail will be also available in the section wizard\u2019s detail list. You can add the detail to any section page that can be connected to the detail. The detail page will display the **Name** field (required) and the **Requests** field used to match the detail records to the current section record. Edit the detail page to add other fields. Learn more: [Add an existing detail to a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2030). The new detail\u2019s object, page, and schemas (the client module) will be available in the package to which the changes are saved. If the section where you added the new detail is saved in a different package, saving the changes in the Section wizard will also save the updated object, schema, and section edit page to your package.\nYou can also implement this example in the Detail wizard. As a result, the detail will become available in the section wizard\u2019s detail list. You will be able to add the detail to the section page. Learn more: [Create a detail for subsequent adding to a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2032&anchor=title-150-3)\n## Create a detail to add it to a record page\u200b\nYou can create and set up a detail in the Detail wizard. This is useful for such things as collaboration on no-code customization. The new detail will be available in the section wizard\u2019s detail list and the **Advanced settings** section. You can add the detail to any section page that can be connected to the detail as well as transfer it to another environment. You can follow the same procedure as in the section wizard to create details based on new or existing Creatio objects in the detail wizard. We will explain how to work with the detail wizard by using a custom detail based on a new object as an example.\nExample\nCreate a new **Registration documents** custom detail that displays contacts\u2019 ID cards.\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/create_new_detail/btn_system_designer.png) \u2192 **System Designer**.\n2. In the **System setup** block, click **Detail wizard**.\n3. On the opened page (Fig. 4):\n1. Select \"**Create new object** \" in the **How to create detail?** block.\n2. Specify the new detail\u2019s **title** to display in the Section Wizard\u2019s detail list. In our case, it is \"**Registration documents**.\"\n3. Specify the new object\u2019s **title and unique code** that will help you find the object in the configuration element list. In our case, it is \"**Registration documents** \" and \"**UsrRegistrationDocuments** \" respectively.\nFig. 6 Setting up a detail based on a new object\n![Fig.\u00a06 Setting up a detail based on a new object](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_detail_wizard_add_detail_new_object.png)\n4. Connect the new detail to the **Contacts** section object. To do this:\n1. Click **Page** to set up the detail\u2019s record page (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 Navigating to editing the page\n![Fig.\u00a07 Navigating to editing the page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_open_page_tab_in_detail_wizard.png)\n2. Drag the **Lookup** field from the **New column** list on the left to the workspace on the right (Fig. 8). A **New column** pop-up will appear.\nFig. 8 Creating a lookup field\n![Fig.\u00a08 Creating a lookup field](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/gif_drag_lookup_in_detail_wizard.gif)\n3. Fill out the properties in the **New column** pop-up.\n1. In the **Title** field, specify the display name of the new field, e. g., \"**Contact**.\"\n2. In the **Code** field, specify the unique name for the field in the database, preceded by a prefix, e.g., \"**UsrContact**.\"\nImportant\nThe **Code** field must contain a prefix that identifies the author of the configuration changes. The prefix is specified in the \"Prefix for object name\" system setting. By default, the \"Usr\" value is used.\n3. In the **Lookup** field, **select the section object** , to which the detail must be linked. For example, to link the detail to the records of the **Contacts** section, select the \"**Contact** \" object as the lookup.\nFig. 9 Setting up a lookup column that links a detail to a section\n![Fig.\u00a09 Setting up a lookup column that links a detail to a section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_lookup_detail.png)\n4.
