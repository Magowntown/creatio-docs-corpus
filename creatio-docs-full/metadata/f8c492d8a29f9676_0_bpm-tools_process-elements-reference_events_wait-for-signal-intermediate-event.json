Depending on the element mode, the **Wait for signal** element will wait for one of the following events:\n* A corresponding signal is generated by the [**Throw signal** intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7034) in any other business process.\n* A corresponding Creatio record is modified or deleted.\n---|---  \nExecution| When the expected signal is generated by a **Throw signal** event, or the monitored record is modified or deleted, the **Wait for signal** element activates its outgoing flows and enables the execution of the other actions in the business process.  \n## Wait for signal intermediate event parameters\u200b\nWhich type of signal is received?| Choose which signal activates the event:\n* Select \"Custom signal\" if the event is activated by a [**Throw signal** intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7034) in any business process (the current business process or any other).\n* Select \"Record signal\" if the event is activated whenever an object record is modified or deleted in Creatio.\nThe selected option determines what following parameters will appear in the element setup area.  \n---|---  \nRun following elements in the background| Select this checkbox, if you want any \"User action\" elements activated with the outgoing flows of the current element to run \"in the background.\" When process elements are executed in the background, their loading mask is not displayed, no windows pop up for the user, etc. The user will be able to interact with the elements via the **Business process tasks** tab of the communication panel.  \n## Custom signal mode parameters\u200b\nIn the \"Custom signal\" mode, the **Wait for signal** event is triggered by a [**Throw signal** intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7034) from another process(es).\nSignal| Enter a signal value. Make sure that the field is populated with the custom-generated signal name matching the name of the signal specified in the **Which signal is generated?** field of the **Throw signal** element (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) in the corresponding process.
