  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Service Enterprise\nOn this page\nCreatio implements the \"Service level management\" ITSM process in the **Service agreements** section. Use this section to determine the customer service requirements, manage your agreements, and in-house service agreements. For each agreement, you can define the individual terms of service and view the statistics.\n## Add service agreements\u200b\nTo add a new service agreement:\n1. **Open** the **Service agreements** section.\n2. **Click** **New**. This opens the page\n3. **Fill out** the service agreement page:\nTitle| Name of the service agreement.  \n---|---  \nType| Type of service agreement:\n* SLA: service level agreement. Use this type to define the service parameters for the end users.\n* OLA: operational level agreement. Use this type to indicate the internal service agreements of your company. For example, the agreements between departments or employee groups.\n* UC: underpinning contract. These are the agreements between your company and its suppliers. If you select the \"UC\" type on the **Contract provisions** tab  \nStatus| Current status of the service agreement, for example, \"New\" or \"Active\".  \nStart/End| The start and end dates of the service agreement validity.  \nCalendar| The calendar that determines workdays and business hours of the support team. Creatio uses calendars to [calculate the response and resolution time](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1552) for service-related cases. Out of the box, the field is populated with the value specified in the \"Base calendar\" (BaseCalendar) system setting. Use the **Calendars** lookup to set up custom calendars. Learn more: [Manage lookup values](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=271).  \nOwner| Name of the user responsible for managing and updating information about the service agreement.  \n4. **Fill out the information** about the [service recipients](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1062#title-330-3) and [services](https://academy.creatio.com?id=1062#title-330-4) on the **Contract terms** tab.\n5. **Enter additional information** about the service agreement on the **Attachments** tab. For example, attach a photocopy of the signed agreement.\n6. **Click** **Save**.\nAs a result, the new service agreement record with the specified parameters will appear in the list of the **Service agreements** section.\n## Default service agreement\u200b\nIn addition to the agreements that have the specific service consumers, the **Service agreements** section must include an agreement that includes the minimum set of services, provided to any consumer, i.e., a default service agreement.\nThis agreement can be used to obtain customer support service when no appropriate service agreement is found for a particular case.\nSpecify the default service agreement in the \"Default service agreement\" (\"DefaultServicePact\" code) system setting. Learn more: [Manage system settings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=269)\n## Add service objects to SLA\u200b\nView information about the service objects on the **Active service recipients** expanded list of the service agreement page.\nTo specify service objects for a service agreement:\n1. **Open** the **Service agreements** section.\n2. **Open** the needed record.\n3. **Add** relevant accounts, contacts, or departments to the **Active service recipients** expanded list:\n1. Click **New** at the bottom of the expanded list \u2192 **Account** , **Contact** , or **Department**.\n2. Click ![btn_edit.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/manage_service_agreements/btn_edit.png) \u2192 ![btn_select.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/manage_service_agreements/btn_select.png).\n3. Select the needed account, contact, or department \u2192 **Save all**.\nAs a result, Creatio will use the information on the **Service recipients** list when [selecting a service agreement](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1553) on the case page.\n## Add services to SLA\u200b\nSet up a list of services provided under a service agreement on the **Available services in contract** expanded list of the service agreement page.\nTo add a service to a service agreement:\n1. **Open** the **Service agreements** section.\n2. **Open** the needed record.\n3. **Click** ![btn_add.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/manage_service_agreements/btn_add.png) in the **Available services in contract** expanded list. This opens a page.\n4 **Select the service** provided under this service agreement \u2192 **Save**.\nAs a result, Creatio will add the service to the **Available services in contract** expanded list. The service will use the default terms of service provision.\n## Modify service provision terms in SLA\u200b\nServices are added to the service agreements with their default terms of provision: calendars, response, and resolution deadlines. You can modify the terms within the framework of a specific SLA:\n1. **Open** the **Service agreements** section.\n2. **Open** the needed record.\n3. **Double-click a cell** of the relevant service in the **Available services in contract** expanded list. This opens a page.\n4. **Specify the service provisions** within the selected service agreement:\nService| The service provided under the selected agreement.  \n---|---  \nResponse time| Estimated response and resolution time used for processing service-related cases under the corresponding service agreement. Out of the box, Creatio populates the fields using the response and resolution time values specified on the service page of the [**Services** section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1061). However, you can set other values for the selected service. Creatio will use the entered data to calculate the response and resolution time values for cases under the selected service agreement.  \nResolution time  \nStatus| Status of the service provided under the selected service agreement.  \nCalendar| The calendar that is used for providing services under the selected service agreement. If this field is empty, Creatio will calculate the case-related response and resolution time values using the calendar specified in the **Calendar** field of the service agreement page.  \n5. Click **Save**.\nAs a result, Creatio will use the information of the **Available services in contract** expanded list when selecting customer service provisions and [calculating the response and resolution time](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1552) for cases.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Calculate response and resolution time](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1552)\n[Select service agreement](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1553)\n[Manage service catalog](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1061)",
