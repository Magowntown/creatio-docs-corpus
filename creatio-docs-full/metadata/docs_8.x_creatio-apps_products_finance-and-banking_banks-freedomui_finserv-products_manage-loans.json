  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Creatio Financial Services CRM\nOn this page\nThe **Loans** section stores detailed information about loan products issued to customers. Loan records are created automatically at the final stage of an application flow, once the related application is approved, and are populated using the parameters defined in that application.\nFig. 1 Loans workspace\n![Fig.\u00a01 Loans workspace](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Finance_and_Banking/financial_services_8_3_1/manage_loans/scr_loan_page.png)\nCreatio can be integrated with Core Banking Systems (CBS) and third-party platforms to automate data exchange across financial products. These integrations are not provided out of the box but can be implemented using the no-code tools of the Creatio platform. Typical integration scenarios include real-time balance updates, transaction synchronization, card issuance tracking, loan servicing updates, and insurance record maintenance.\nLoans records are created automatically during the final stage of an application flow. Once the application for the corresponding product is approved, Creatio generates a new loan record and populates its fields using the parameters defined in the application\nThe layout of the loan page changes dynamically based on the selected loan type, displaying type-specific blocks, fields, and related data while keeping common loan information available for all loan types.\n## Loan profile\u200b\nField| Description  \n---|---  \nStatus| The current status of the loan (e.g., \"Active,\" \"Closed,\" \"Delinquent\"). Required.  \nNumber| Unique loan number. Required.  \nContact| Individual customer affiliated with this loan. If populated, a separate block displays the customer's profile details (name, age, location, email, and primary phone numbers).  \nType| Type of loan (e.g., \"Unsecured personal loans\"). Determines the layout and fields shown on the page.  \nSubtype| Subtype of loan, filtered by type (e.g., \"Debt consolidation loan\").  \nProduct| The product activated using the loan.  \nContract| Contract associated with the loan. Required.  \nApplication| Application used to create the loan.  \nBranch| Branch or division responsible for the loan.  \n## General loan information\u200b\nField| Description  \n---|---  \nPurpose| Purpose of the loan.  \nPurpose details| Detailed explanation of the loan purpose. Field is visible when loan type is not \"Credit cards,\" \"Auto loans,\" \"Lines of credit.\"  \nLoan amount| Total loan amount issued to the customer.  \nCurrency| Currency in which the loan is issued.  \nAPR, %| Annual percentage rate for the loan.  \nInterest rate, %| Interest rate defined for the loan.  \nOpened on| Date when the loan was opened.  \nMaturity date| Loan maturity date.  \nTerm, months| Loan term specified in months.  \n## Linked and related data\u200b\nThe **Applications** expanded list displays all application records associated with the loan.\nThe **Installment details** block summarizes upcoming and outstanding repayments, providing insight into current obligations without requiring access to the full payment schedule.\nThe **Payment schedule** block displays all planned and actual payments, helping users monitor repayment progress and identify delays.\nThe **Credit limit change log** block maintains a full history of credit limit changes, including their source \u2014 case, application, or pre-approved credit limit offer.\n### Pre-approved credit limit offers\u200b\nCreatio supports pre-approved credit limit increase (CLI) offers. These allow financial institutions to propose higher credit limits to eligible customers proactively based on internal evaluations or marketing campaigns.\nThe most recent offer with:\n* type: \"Requires confirmation\"\n* status: \"Pending\"\n* a valid expiration date\nis stored directly in the loan record for quick access and further processing.\n### Transactions\u200b\nThe **Transactions** expanded list displays all transaction records associated with the loan, including transaction number, status, amount, currency, balance, transaction date, write-off date, and comments.\n### Cards\u200b\nThe **Cards** expanded list displays all cards details associated with the loan. This can include supplementary cards or cards tied to the same loan.\n## Lines of credit (LOC)\u200b\nFor loans that have \"Line of credit (LOC)\" type, loan page contains the following expanded lists:\n* **Line of credit details** on the **General information** tab\n* **Cards** on the **General information** tab\n* **Transactions** on the **Servicing** tab\nFor these loans, the system enables tracking of revolving balances, available credit, draw schedules, and repayment phases. The UI supports multiple linked cards, allowing users to view usage history and manage account-level rules.\n## Credit card loans\u200b\nFor loans that have \"Credit cards\" type, Creatio displays the following expanded lists:\n* **Credit card loan details** on the **General information** tab\n* **Pre-approved credit limit offer** on the **General information** tab\n* **Credit limit change log** on the **Servicing** tab\n* **Transactions** on the **Servicing** tab\nThis type enables detailed monitoring of card-linked credit facilities. Fields related to statement cycles, minimum payments, grace periods, and APRs are displayed. A direct reference to the associated credit card ensures alignment between transactional data and loan-level reporting.\n## Unsecured personal loans\u200b\nFor loans that have \"Unsecured personal loans\" type, Creatio displays following data:\n* **Personal loan details** field group on the **General information** tab\n* **Installment details** field group on the **General information** tab\n* **Payment schedule** expanded list on the **Servicing** tab\nIt provides a comprehensive view of the loan structure and repayment progress, helping users effectively manage unsecured personal lending.\n## Auto loans\u200b\nFor loans that have \"Auto loans\" type, Creatio displays the following blocks:\n* **Auto loan details** field group on the **General information** tab\n* **Collateral details** field on the **General information** tab\n* **Installment details** field group on the **General information** tab\n* **Payment schedule** expanded list on the **Servicing** tab\nFor this loan type, the loan record contains general parameters such as purpose, loan amount, interest rate, currency, opening date, maturity date, and repayment terms, along with installment details. These fields ensure that both the asset securing the loan and the core loan terms are available in a single, unified view.\nAll vehicle-related information, including but not limited to model, year, VIN, mileage, lienholder, and assessed value, is stored in the **Collateral details** field. This centralizes all collateral data for consistent tracking and easier access.\n**As a result,** users can manage all loan types while monitoring repayment schedules, limits, collateral, and linked applications.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Manage insurances](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2629)\n[Manage cards](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2630)\n[Manage bank accounts](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2631)\n[Product catalog](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/product-catalog)",
