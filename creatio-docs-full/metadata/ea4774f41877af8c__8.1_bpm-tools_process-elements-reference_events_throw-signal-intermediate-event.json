  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nThe **Throw signal** intermediate event (Fig. 1) is used to broadcast signals that can be caught by corresponding process elements in any business process. It works in the same manner as the [**Throw message** intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7033), but unlike the latter, the signal of the **Throw signal** intermediate event is sent to all active processes in Creatio.\nFig. 1 Throw signal intermediate event\n![Fig.\u00a01 Throw signal intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_process_designer_throw_signal_event.png)\nFor example, after finishing processing an order as part of one process, you can notify all other processes that a new order has been processed.\nThis signal will advance another process to the shipment document preparation stage (Fig. 2)\nFig. 2 Activating the Wait for signal intermediate event\n![Fig.\u00a02 Activating the Wait for signal intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_process_designer_catch_signal_event1.png)\nAt the same time, the same **Throw signal** event will initiate a \"post-order survey\" process\nFig. 3 Activating theSignalstart event\n![Fig.\u00a03 Activating theSignalstart event](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_process_designer_catch_signal_start_event.png)\n## Throw signal intermediate event operation\u200b\nActivation| When the element incoming flow is activated, the **Throw signal** event broadcasts its signal and activates its outgoing flows. As a result:\n* All [**Wait for signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7031) elements in the \"Custom signal\" mode that await the generated signal and whose incoming flows have been activated - will activate their outgoing flows.\n* All business processes whose starting element is [**Signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7027) start event in the \"Custom signal\" mode, which awaits the generated signal - will start.\n---|---  \nExecution| After broadcasting the signal, the **Throw signal** element activates its outgoing flows.  \n## Throw signal intermediate event parameters\u200b\nWhich signal is generated?| Enter the name of the signal event that will be broadcast. Make sure that the signal name (Fig. 4) matches the name(s) of the signal(s) specified in the **Signal** field of the **Wait for signal** (Fig. 5) and the **Signal** start event (Fig. 6).  \n---|---  \nFig. 3 Specifying the name of a signal that activates the Wait for signal intermediate event(s) or the Signal start event in the corresponding business processes\n![Fig.\u00a03 Specifying the name of a signal that activates the Wait for signal intermediate event\\(s\\) or the Signal start event in the corresponding business processes](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_throw_signal_example1.png)\nFig. 4 Example of the Wait for signal intermediate event that catches the corresponding signal\n![Fig.\u00a04 Example of the Wait for signal intermediate event that catches the corresponding signal](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_wait_signal_example.png)\nFig. 5 Example of the Signal start event that is triggered by the corresponding Throw signal event\n![Fig.\u00a05 Example of the Signal start event that is triggered by the corresponding Throw signal event](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_signal_example.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Process events](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2318)\n[Use events in a business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7079)",
