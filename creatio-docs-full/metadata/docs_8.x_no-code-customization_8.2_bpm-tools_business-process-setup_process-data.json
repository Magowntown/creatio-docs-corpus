  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nBusiness processes in Creatio can interact with Creatio records, which are generally referred to as \"data.\" A business process can let the user interact with data in a specific way, or work with data on the background, without the user involvement.\nThis article covers the principles of how business processes work with Creatio section, detail or lookup records (or \"data\").\nEvery practical task in Creatio involves working with section, detail or lookup records. To automate these tasks, all business processes in Creatio have to interact with data in one way or another.\nHere are some of the more typical cases of working with data:\nBusiness task| Creatio task| Process task  \n---|---|---  \nSchedule a meeting with the customer.| Create a new record in the **Activities** section.| Add new data  \nSet opportunity amount same as the opportunity budget| Obtain the value of the **Budget** field of a specific record in the **Opportunities** section| Read existing data  \nModify the **Amount** field of the same record.| Modify existing data  \nClear employee\u2019s schedule for the next week| Delete records in the **Activities** section that have specific values in the **Owner** and **Start** fields.| Delete data  \nCheck Creatio marketplace for free business process templates illustrating the examples of working with Creatio data using business processes.\nAfter [installing the marketplace template](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1836), a new \"Academy examples\" folder will appear in the **Process library** section. It will contain 4 processes: \"**Read data process element** ,\" \"**Modify data process element** ,\" \"**Delete data process element** ,\" and \"**Add data process element** ,\" each containing several examples of using the said element, covered in this article.\nIn all these cases, specific data must be accessed in a business process and specific changes must be made to the Creatio database as a result.\nWhen working with data, a business process can obtain it directly from the database, or use data that has been obtained earlier. Any data obtained from the database, generated by the process itself or entered by the user are available as the parameter values and can be accessed by the process at any time.\nAs you can see, working with data boils down to four basic operations: adding, modifying, reading and deleting data. In the next chapter, we are going to examine how these operations are implemented in the Creatio business process engine.\n## Operations with data\u200b\nOn the database level, all interactions with data boil down to four basic \"CRUD\" operations: creating, reading, updating and deleting records. Most business process tasks perform these operations automatically, as part of their logic:\n* [**Perform task**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7009), [**Send email**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7127) \u2013 create new records.\n* [**Open edit page**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7012), [**Pre-configured page**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7008), [**Approval**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7134) \u2013 create and update records.\n* [**Signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7027) start event and [**Wait for signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7031) \u2013 read records.\nIn addition, there are four business process elements in Creatio that are designed for performing each of the CRUD operations with data. Usually, data-specific tasks are used in the following cases:\n* [**Read data**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7023) \u2013 regular process tasks require data that is not available in the process.\n* [**Add data**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7020), [**Modify data**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7018), [**Delete data**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7017) \u2013 you need to create, update or delete Creatio records on the background, without opening any pages or creating tasks for the process user.\nRegardless of the use case, the setup of each data-related process task includes several typical steps.\n### Read data\u200b\n* Identify the **object** that contains the record to read and the **columns** whose values must be read.\n* Identify the **record** whose values must be read.\n### Add data\u200b\n* Identify the **object** to add records in and the **columns** will be populated for the new record.\n* Identify the **data** , which will be written into the columns of the new record: these can be static values or values obtained from other process parameters.\n### Modify data\u200b\n* Identify the **object** that contains the record to modify and the **columns** whose values must be changed.\n* Identify the **record** whose values must be modified.\n* Identify the **data** , which will be written into the columns of the modified record: these can be static values or values obtained from other process parameters.\n### Delete data\u200b\n* Identify the **object** to delete records in.\n* Identify the **record** to delete.\nAs you can see, using the four basic operations in the Creatio business process engine involves three general steps: identifying the object and the column, identifying the needed record and identifying the source of the new data.\n## Identify objects and columns\u200b\nAs you can see, each data-related operation requires that you identify Creatio object, which contains the needed data. Additionally, all operations (with the exception of the \"Delete data\") require that you specify the columns, whose values must be read, added or modified. For example:\n* To schedule a meeting with a customer in Creatio, you need to add a **record** to the \"Activity\" **object** and fill out its **Subject** , **Start** , **Due** , as well as **Contact** and/or **Account columns**.\n* To set the amount of an opportunity same as its budget, you need to:\n* Read the value in the **Budget column** of a specific **record** in the \"Opportunity\" **object**.\n* Modify the **Amount record** in the \"Opportunity\" **object** , by setting its value to the one that you obtained from the **Budget column**.\n* To clear an employee\u2019s schedule for the next week, you need to delete specific **records** in the \"Activity\" **object**.\nAll Creatio data is stored as **column** values of **records** from different **objects** (Fig. 1):\nFig. 1 Object - column - record structure in Creatio\n![Fig.\u00a01 Object - column - record structure in Creatio](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_chapter_bpms_data_object_record_column.png)\nTo use the needed Creatio data in your business process, you need to identify the needed object, columns and records:\n* The object (section, detail or lookup). Creatio objects are roughly equivalent to database **tables**. For example, the **Account** object contains all accounts, **Activity** object contains all activities, etc.\n* The object columns (or \"fields\"). Creatio columns are equivalent to database **table columns**. For example, the \"Name\" column contains account names, \"Created on\" \u2013 the dates when accounts were created, etc.\n* The record (an \"instance\" of the object). Creatio records are equivalent to database **table rows**. For example, a record is a particular account, contact, or activity.\n## Identify necessary records\u200b\nWhen looking for specific data, you usually know the object and the columns, since you understand what information is needed (e. g., \"I need the name of a certain contact\"). The trick is to identify the needed record (in this case, specific contact).\nThere are two ways of selecting records:\n* Using a **logic condition** , i. e., a \"filter.\" For example, you need to read, modify or delete all records in the \"Activity\" object, where the **Status** column contains \"Canceled.\"\n* Using a **record Id** , which can be obtained from a process or element parameter.\n### Identify a specific record\u200b\n**Record Id** is a column value that uniquely identifies a record in Creatio database. Record Id is stored in the **Id** column, which is available in all Creatio objects (Fig. 2). When working with business processes, you can obtain a record Id from process or element parameters.\n**Process parameters** are special kind of process properties that store data used for process and element execution, as well as data that is the result of such execution. Learn more: [Process parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7054).\nFig. 2 Schematic view of the Id column in the Contact object\n![Fig.\u00a02 Schematic view of the Id column in the Contact object](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_chapter_bpms_data_object_record_column_example.png)\nThere are three general cases of obtaining a record Id when designing a business process:\n* From a process parameter. Such parameters are usually available in processes that are used as sub-processes, as well as processes that are run manually, by a specific record.\n* From an object signal element \u2013 start [**Signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7027) or intermediate [**Wait for signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7031) events in the \"Object signal\" mode (triggered by changes in Creatio records).\n* From an outgoing parameter of a process element that was working with the needed record.\nThe following process elements work with data automatically and have outgoing parameters that store field values of Creatio records:\n* [**Perform task**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7009) \u2013 field values of the task activity, including its Id.\n* [**Open edit page**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7012) \u2013 field values of the corresponding record.\n* [**Pre-configured page**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7008) \u2013 if a data source object is set, the element has parameters for all of the object columns.\n* [**Send email**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7127) \u2013 field values of the email record (\"From,\" \"To,\" Ids of linked records, etc.).\n* [**Signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7027) \u2013 for object signals, Id of the record that triggered the signal.\n* [**Wait for signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7031) \u2013 for record signals, Id of the record that triggered the signal.\n* [**Sub-process**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7041) \u2013 any outgoing parameters of the business process selected as a sub-process.\nYou can identify the needed record by Id, obtained from process and element parameters when either of the following is true:\n* The process start element is [**Signal**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7027) in the \"object signal\" mode (the process starts automatically when data in a specific Creatio object is changed).\n* The process is run by the needed record: initiated manually from the record page or as part of a dynamic case.\n* Previous process elements have already worked with this record, and you need to work with the same record repeatedly.\n#### Map the parameters\u200b\nIf the Id of the needed record is available in a process or element parameter, you can use parameter mapping to specify it in the filter area of the **Read data** , **Modify data** , or **Delete data** element (Fig. 3). You essentially need to create a filter by the **Id** column and select \"Compare with Parameter\" in the menu when specifying the column value.\nFig. 3 Filter a record by Id\n![Fig.\u00a03 Filter a record by Id](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_chapter_bpms_data_filter_by_id.png)\nIn the opened window (Fig. 4), select the process or element that contains the parameter whose value will be the needed Id.\nFig. 4 Select a process parameter that contains the Id of the needed record\n![Fig.\u00a04 Select a process parameter that contains the Id of the needed record](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_chapter_bpms_data_start_signal_parameter_id.png)\nAs a result, the filter will always return one record, since two records cannot have the same Id in Creatio database.\nLearn more: [Use process parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7165).\n### Identify a set of records via conditions\u200b\nUsually, you want to identify by using regular filter criteria if:\n* A process task must work with a selection of records: read a collection of records, modify or delete all records that match criteria.\n* A process task must work with a single record that match the selection criteria (\"the first record in selection\").\nTo identify records using criteria, you need to apply a filter by the needed columns, using standard Creatio filter module in conjunction with record sorting rules (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 The record selection criteria\n![Fig.\u00a05 The record selection criteria](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_chapter_bpms_data_filter_example.png)\nFor example, filter activities by the **Type** and **Status** fields and sort the results in the descending order to select the latest completed call.\nYou can also enable precise time values in filters by date. To do this, specify \"true\" in the **Consider time in the filter** parameter in the advanced mode of the element setup area.\nFig. 6 Enabling the time values in filters by date\n![Fig.\u00a06 Enabling the time values in filters by date](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Release_notes/release_notes_7_17_4/data_time_filter.gif)\nLearn more: [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017).\n## Identify new data to write upon create or update\u200b\nUse outgoing parameters to specify new data to populate the fields of records added or changed as part of the process.\nAfter finishing their operations with data, process elements pass data to their outgoing parameters for further use. For example, after an activity is created via the **Perform task** element, its Id and other data are passed to the outgoing parameters (Fig. 7). Using these parameters, you can access that same activity later, down the process flow.\nFig. 7 Parameters of a Perform task element with activity data\n![Fig.\u00a07 Parameters of a Perform task element with activity data](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_chapter_bpms_data_activity_parameters.png)\nThe parameters match the name and type of the corresponding Creatio fields. For example, a contact\u2019s job title is stored in a \"String\" (text) field and is passed to a \"Text\" parameter, while the due date of an activity is stored in a \"Date/time\" field, and is passed to a \"Date/time\" parameter.\n## Process elements for CRUD operations and use examples\u200b\nIn addition, there are four process elements for working with data specifically, one per each possible operation:\n![scr_process_designer_read_data.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_data/scr_process_designer_read_data.png) [**Read data**](hhttps://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7023)|  Obtain data from the database for later use in the business process. The fetched data is stored in the outgoing parameters of the **Read data** element.
