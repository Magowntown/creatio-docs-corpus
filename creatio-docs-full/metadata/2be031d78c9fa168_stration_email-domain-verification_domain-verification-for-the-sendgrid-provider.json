  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0Marketing\nOn this page\nIf you use SendGrid for sending marketing emails, you will need to verify your email address and your corporate domain to allow the provider to send emails on your behalf.\nIf your recipients use Microsoft Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail, and other common mailing services, they can see that an email was sent from your provider's server on your behalf (this information is available in the \"From\" field). For example, if you are sending emails via SendGrid, the \"From\" field of the emails may contain the following text: \"Your Manager `<info@creatio.com>` via sendgrid.net\".\nThe procedure for domain verification for SendGrid consists of several stages:\n1. Add your corporate domain on the **Bulk email settings** page. Read more >>>\n2. Obtain MX-, SPF-, and DKIM records. Read more >>>\n3. Create a DMARC record. Read more >>>\n4. Specify the needed records in the DNS area of your domain Read more >>>\nnote\nOnly custom email domains can be verified. Public domains (for example, gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.) cannot be verified. We do not recommend using public domains for bulk emails. Such emails have a high risk of being marked as spam and ruining the reputation of the sender IP address.\n## Add your corporate domain on the Bulk email settings page\u200b\nSendGrid users need to add their corporate domain to Creatio before starting their emails. To do this:\n1. In the **Emails** section, select **Bulk email settings** in the **Actions** menu (Fig. 1)\nFig. 1 Opening the bulk email settings page\n![Fig.\u00a01 Opening the bulk email settings page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_domain_verification/BPMonlineHelp/email_domain_verification_sendgrid/scr_section_email_bulk_settings_page.png)\n2. On the **Bulk email settings** page, specify the domain of the necessary email address in the **Sender domain** area, i.e., \"mycompany.com\" (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 The Sender domains tab\n![Fig.\u00a02 The Sender domains tab](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_domain_verification/BPMonlineHelp/email_domain_verification_sendgrid/scr_section_email_sender_domains.png)\n## Get setup keys for your domain\u200b\nMX-, SPF- and DKIM records are generated automatically in the **Email** section once the domain is added to the email settings page. To obtain these records, in the **Email** section, select **Email settings** in the **Actions** menu.\nThe SPF and DKIM records will be generated automatically in the **DKIM/SPF setup instructions** area on the **Bulk email settings** page (Fig. 3) for your specified domain once your email is verified.\nFig. 3 MX/DKIM/SPF keys for the specified domain\n![Fig.\u00a03 MX/DKIM/SPF keys for the specified domain](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_domain_verification/BPMonlineHelp/email_domain_verification_sendgrid/scr_section_email_mx_spf_dkim_record_valies_sendgrid.png)\nImportant\nMX-, SPF- and DKIM records of the SendGrid provider are different for different domains.\n## Create a DMARC record\u200b\nSince February 2024, Google and Yahoo implemented new email authentication requirements for all email senders to improve deliverability and prevent spam. Besides SPF and DKIM records, DMARC record is also required.\nCreatio does not require a DMARC record to validate a domain. Analyze your marketing strategy and decide whether a DMARC record is required in your case, for example, if you have a lot of recipients that use Yahoo.\nA DMARC record follows this pattern:\nv=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:user@domain.com; ruf=mailto:user@domain.com;  \nConfigure the exact parameters based on your business goals. View them in the table below.\n**Parameter name**| **Parameter value**  \n---|---  \n**v**|  Indicates the DMARC version used. Required. Set it to `v=DMARC1`.  \n**p**|  Determines how to handle messages that fail DMARC authentication. Required. The following values are available:\n* `p=none` (Monitor Mode). Emails that do not pass authentication are still delivered to the recipient's inbox. This is useful if you only want to monitor and collect data on messages that fail DMARC checks.\n* `p=quarantine` (Quarantine Mode). Depending on the recipient server, emails that fail DMARC authentication are either sent to a separate spam/quarantine folder or rejected. This lets you review and analyze potentially fraudulent emails.\n* `p=reject` (Reject Mode): Emails that fail DMARC checks are outright rejected by the recipient. This means that these messages are not delivered to the recipient's inbox, providing a higher level of protection against phishing and spoofing attacks.\nThe exact mode to use depends on your business goals. However, if you want to use a stricter mode, we recommend using less strict modes first to ensure legitimate emails are not blocked inadvertently.  \n**rua**|  Specifies the email address to send aggregate reports that let you gain insights into the authentication status of your domain's emails. Optional.  \n**ruf**|  Specifies the email address to send forensic reports. Optional.  \n## Add records to the DNS area of your domain\u200b\nTo verify the mail domain using the SendGrid provider, you need to add the MX, SPF to the DNS area of the mail domain settings, otherwise, the domain reputation and the mail delivery quality are not guaranteed.\nnote\nWe recommend looking into the examples provided in the [Recommendations on setting up the popular DNS providers article](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1977).\n### Specify MX record in the DNS area of your domain\u200b\n**MX record** is the primary record in the domain zone; it specifies mailing host names of the domain. The email server checks if MX records are available in the DNS zone and whether they match the sender\u2019s IP address. If the data is unavailable or the IP addresses do not match, the remote server is very likely to deny sending and receiving emails.\nUnlike SPF and DKIM records, the syntax of MS records includes priorities. **Priority** is specified as an integer; it indicates the order in which the availability of email servers is checked. The highest possible priority is \"0.\" You can add several MS records with equal priority.\nAn MX record looks like this:\nName| Priority| Type| Value  \n---|---|---|---  \nsubdomain.yourdomain.com| 0| mx| mx.sendgrid.net.  \nThe subdomain name is unique and is generated by the provider.\n### Specify SPF record in the DNS area of your domain\u200b\nCopy the generated SPF record from the **DKIM/SPF setup instructions** area on the **Bulk email settings** page, which will look as follows: The record will look as follows:\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \nsubdomain.yourdomain.com| TXT| v=spf1 a mx include:_spf.sendgrid.com ~all  \nThe subdomain name is unique and is generated by the provider. Add a separate record for each subdomain.\n### Specify DKIM record in the DNS area of your domain\u200b\nAfter the configuration of the SPF record, you need to add DKIM records. For the SendGrid provider, the record must look like this:\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \nm1._domainkey| TXT| k=rsa; t=s; p=XXXXXXXXXXXXX  \nIn the record above, \"XXXXXXXXXXXXX\" is an **individual key** for each domain. The key is generated automatically and is available on the **Sender domains** tab.\nCertain DNS settings may require entering the provided subdomain in the \"Host / Name\" field in the following format: \"m1._domainkey.yourdomain.com\"\nnote\nDetailed information about MX, SPF, and DKIM record setup is available in the [SendGrid online guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).\n### Specify DMARC record in the DNS area of your domain\u200b\nIf your business goals require it, add the DMARC record you created. The record must look as follows:\nName| Type| Value  \n---|---|---  \n_dmarc| TXT| v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:user@domain.com; ruf=mailto:user@domain.com;  \n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Domain verification for the Elastic Email provider](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1714)\n[Recommendations on setting up the popular DNS providers](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1977)",
