In the **Which data read mode to use?** field, select \"Read the first record in the selection.\"\n2. In the **Which object to read data from?** field, select \"Activity participant.\"\n3. In the **How to filter records?** area, set the filter \"Id = Participant added.Record ID\". To do this, click `<Add condition>`, select the \"Id\" column, then in the appeared menu, select **Compare with parameter**. In the opened window, select the **Record ID** parameter of the \"Participant added\" element.\nFig. 2 The Read activity participant element properties\n![Fig.\u00a02 The Read activity participant element properties](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_designer_case_activityparticipant_read_participant.png)\n5. Set up the \"Read activity title\" element parameters to read the activity title, to which a participant has been added (Fig. 3):\nFig. 3 The Read activity title element properties\n![Fig. 3 The Read activity title element properties](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_designer_case_activityparticipant_read_activity_title.png)\n1. In the **Which data read mode to use?** field, select \"Read the first record in the selection.\"\n2. In the **Which object to rad data from?** field, select \"Activity.\"\n3. In the **How to filter records** area, set up filter \"id = Read activity participant.First element of the resulting collection.Activity\". To do this, click `<Add condition>`, select the \"Id\" column, then in the appeared menu, select **Compare with parameter**. In the opened window, select the \"Activity\" parameter of the \"Read activity participant\" element.\n4.

After creating the process elements, connect each element with the next one by dragging the ![icn_process_elements_connection_straight00014.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/icn_process_elements_connection_straight00014.png) element in the upper right corner of the selected process element.\n10. Save the created business process.\nAs a result of the business process, an email is sent to an employee that was added to the list of participants in the activity.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Notify employees by email when a lead has been received via a landing page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2358)",
