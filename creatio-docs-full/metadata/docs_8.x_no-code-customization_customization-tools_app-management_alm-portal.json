  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nThe Creatio ALM Portal is a centralized tool designed to streamline work with multiple Creatio instances. It provides self-service actions for environment management, real-time monitoring capabilities, and a unified workspace for collaboration across projects.\nUse the ALM Portal to manage and monitor environments while developing and testing apps of any complexity in the No-Code Designer. You can access the ALM Portal at studio.creatio.com.\nThis tool enables efficient team collaboration during application setup and testing. Every team member can view the active environments and access implemented solutions in real time.\nOnce you complete your registration with the ALM Portal, you will have a user account and an organization account.\nImportant\nThe ALM Portal functionality varies depending on your Creatio deployment. **The trial websites** have access to the full ALM Portal functionality described in this article. **Creatio cloud users** need to contact [Creatio support](mailto:support@creatio.com) to enable the complete ALM Portal Cloud feature set. In **Creatio on-site** , the ALM Portal displays the applications of a specific environment only, without the ability to switch between environments, invite users, deploy apps, or manage the profile.\n* A **user account** is required to log in to the ALM Portal and environments.\n* An **organization account** is required to share apps and collaborate on them with coworkers. By default, every new user who registers on their own (as opposed to following an invite link in the email) has an organization account. To **collaborate** in the ALM Portal, invite team members. Set the team member permissions using the following roles:\n* **Administrator** has full access to company environments and permissions to manage them. In addition to the edit privileges, an administrator can invite other users for collaboration or remove users from the organization. An organization can have more than one administrator, but at least one administrator is required.\n* **Developer** has full access to development and testing environments, as well as trials ordered by the organization\u2019s employees. An organization can have more than one developer.\nIf one of the administrators deletes their user account, other team members can continue working on the apps of the organization. The last remaining administrator user cannot be deleted from an organization.\n## Invite team members\u200b\n1. Click **Add user** in the **Users** menu (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Open the Users menu in the ALM Portal\n![Fig. 1 Open the Users menu in the ALM Portal](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_hub_users.png)\n2. Click **Add user**. This opens the user invitation page.\n3. Enter the email and role of the user to invite for collaboration and click **Invite** on the page.\nFig. 2 Invite a user\n![Fig.\u00a02 Invite a user](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_hub_add_user.png)\n**As a result** , Creatio will send an ALM Portal invite to the specified email address. The invited user will appear in the **Users** menu with the specified role and \"**Invited** \" status.\nIf the user accepts the invitation and signs up, their status changes to \"**Active**.\"\nnote\nYou can only invite users that do not have an ALM Portal account yet.\nYou can manage users in the **Users** menu if you have administrator permissions.\nIf the user status is \"Invited,\" you can cancel or resend the invite, as well as edit the user data, such as their role. To select an action, hover over the row that has the relevant user, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/btn_menu.png), and select the needed item.\nFig. 3 The action menu for invited users\n![Fig.\u00a03 The action menu for invited users](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_hub_actions_user.png)\nIf you want to edit user data, select **Edit**. This opens a page.\nEnter new data and click **Save** on the page that opens.\nFig. 4 Edit the user profile\n![Fig. 4 Edit the user profile](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_hub_edit_user.png)\nYou can activate or edit the profile of inactive users in the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/btn_menu.png) button menu.\n## Select an operating environment\u200b\nThe ALM Portal contains a unified library of your company\u2019s environments. Use the library to organize site customization efforts.\nTo view the list of available environments, click the menu in the top right (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 The list of environments in the ALM Portal\n![Fig.\u00a05 The list of environments in the ALM Portal](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCodePlatform/ALM_portal/scr_alm_portal_change_environment.png)\nThe list of environments displays both current cloud environments of your company and trials ordered by the organization participants. Creatio displays the current status of each environment using the icon to the left of the environment.\nYou can switch between the environments of your organization without repeated log in. This is achieved with Creatio ID functionality based on the SSO mechanism. After you sign up with the ALM Portal, you can open any site of your organization so long as you have permissions to access the site. When you log in to the site, Creatio automatically adds a user account linked to the main account in the ALM Portal.\nYou can **select** the environment and proceed to manage its apps, the environment itself, or open the configuration (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 The environment menu\n![Fig.\u00a06 The environment menu](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCodePlatform/ALM_portal/scr_alm_portal_environmet_actions.png)\n## Get application logs for the environment\u200b\nYou can request application logs for a specific environment directly from the **ALM Portal**. This helps track system events, investigate errors, and review performance activity within a defined time range.\nTo request application logs:\n1. **Select the required environment** \u2192 **Environment details**. This opens the environment details page where you can check most important information about environment and perform self-service actions, like getting application logs.\n2. **Click the Order applications logs** button.\n3. **Click Order** to submit the request.\n**As a result,** the request will appear in the **Application logs requests** expanded list, where you can track its creation date, creator, range, and status. Fetching logs is an asynchronous action and can take nearly 15 minutes. Once the logs are ready, the link for logs download will appear and the status of your request will change to \"Completed\". Additionally, you will get an email notification.\nFig. 7 The link to download application logs\n![Fig.\u00a07 The link to download application logs](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/NoCodePlatform/ALM_portal/scr_alm_portal_environment_logs_download.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a custom app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2377)\n[Manage apps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2444)\n[Freedom UI Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376)\n[Pricing model and its caps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2567)",
