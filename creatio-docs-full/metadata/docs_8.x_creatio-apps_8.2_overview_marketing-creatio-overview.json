You can visualize stats in multiple ways, including charts, calculated indicators, and special lists.\nThe analytics is available in the following areas:\n* **Analytics** **view** of certain Creatio sections. This view displays the general stats for section records (taking the current filters into account), for example, campaign dynamics and audience, lead generation channels, or the list of upcoming events.\n* On **record pages**. You can display analytical data on a per-record basis. For example, a bulk email page provides sending and delivery charts, individual recipient responses, the click heatmap, and the click-through rate for the currently opened email campaign, as opposed to similar rates for all emails in the section.\n* In the \"**Dashboards** \" **section**. The section displays Creatiowide analytics based on data from different Creatio sections, for example, the lead-to-revenue funnel, the list of employees of the month, event totals, etc.\nYou can customize existing dashboards. It is also possible to add new analytics widgets to any Freedom UI page in a few clicks.\nFig. 8 Dashboard page\n![Fig.\u00a08 Dashboard page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Overview/marketing_creatio_overview/scr_dashboard_page.png)\nLearn more: [Analytics](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/analytics).\n### AI tools\u200b\nUse AI tools to speed up routine tasks and increase the performance of your employees.
