  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3\nOn this page\nLevel: advanced\nYou can configure object events (saving, editing, deleting, etc.) in the following **ways** :\n* In the Creatio UI using event subprocesses of the Object Designer.\n* In the Creatio back-end using development tools.\n## Mechanism of the Entity event layer\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `Entity` event layer is to configure object event handlers in the Creatio back-end using development tools. Creatio supports only those handlers that are defined in the main configuration and file content assemblies. Handlers from external assemblies are not supported.\nImportant\nCreatio triggers the mechanism of the `Entity` event layer after executing the object event subprocesses.\nThe event layer can handle the following **object events** :\n* `OnDeleted` after a record is deleted.\n* `OnInserted` after a record is added.\n* `OnInserting` before a record is added.\n* `OnDeleting` before a record is deleted.\n* `OnSaved` after a record is saved.\n* `OnSaving` before a record is saved.\n* `OnUpdated` after a record is updated.\n* `OnUpdating` before a record is updated.\nThe following **components** implement the mechanism of the `Entity` event layer:\n* `BaseEntityEventListener`. Provides the handler methods of object events\n* `EntityAfterEventArgs`. Provides the properties with the arguments of the handler method that is executed after the event triggers.\n* The `EntityBeforeEventArgs` class. Provides the properties with the arguments of the handler method that is executed before the event fires.\n* The `EntityEventListener` attribute. Registers the listener.\n### BaseEntityEventListener class\u200b\nThe purpose of the `Terrasoft.Core.Entities.Events.BaseEntityEventListener` class is to provide the handler methods of various object events. View the handler methods in the table below.\nHandler method| Method description  \n---|---  \nOnDeleted(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e)| Handles events after a record is deleted.  \nOnDeleting(object sender, EntityBeforeEventArgs e)| Handles events before a record is deleted.  \nOnInserted(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e)| Handles events after a record is added.  \nOnInserting(object sender, EntityBeforeEventArgs e)| Handles events before a record is added.  \nOnSaved(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e)| Handles events after a record is saved.  \nOnSaving(object sender, EntityBeforeEventArgs e)| Handles events before a record is saved.  \nOnUpdated(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e)| Handles events after a record is updated.  \nOnUpdating(object sender, EntityBeforeEventArgs e)| Handles events before a record is updated.  \nThe methods of the `BaseEntityEventListener` class have the following **parameters** :\n* `sender`. The link to the object instance that generates the event.\n* `e`. The event arguments. Can take on the `EntityAfterEventArgs` (after the event) or `EntityBeforeEventArgs` (before the event) value.\nView the call sequence of the event handler methods in the table below.\nCreate an object record| Edit an object| Delete an object  \n---|---|---  \nOnSaving()OnInserting()OnInserted()OnSaved()| OnSaving()OnUpdating()OnUpdated()OnSaved()| OnDeleting()OnDeleted()  \nEvent handlers retrieve the instance of `UserConnection` from the `sender` parameter. View an example that retrieves `UserConnection` below.\nExample that retrieves UserConnection\n[EntityEventListener(SchemaName = \"Activity\")]  \npublic class ActivityEntityEventListener: BaseEntityEventListener {  \npublic override void OnSaved(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e) {  \nbase.OnSaved(sender, e);  \nvar entity = (Entity) sender;  \nvar userConnection = entity.UserConnection;  \n}  \n}  \n### EntityAfterEventArgs class\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `Terrasoft.Core.Entities.EntityAfterEventArgs` class is to provide properties with the arguments of the handler method that is executed after the event fires.\nThe `EntityAfterEventArgs` class has the following **properties** :\n* `ModifiedColumnValues`. A collection of the modified columns.\n* `PrimaryColumnValue`. The record ID.\n### EntityBeforeEventArgs class\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `Terrasoft.Core.Entities.EntityBeforeEventArgs` class is to provide properties with the arguments of the handler method that is executed before the event triggers.\nThe `EntityBeforeEventArgs` class has the following **properties** :\n* `KeyValue`. The record ID.\n* `IsCanceled`. Enables canceling the further event execution.\n* `AdditionalCondition`. Enables providing additional description of the object filter conditions before the action.\n### EntityEventListener attribute\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `EntityEventListener` attribute is to register a listener. The listener can be linked to all objects (`IsGlobal = true`) or to a specific object (for example, `SchemaName = \"Contact\"`). You can tag one listener class with many attributes to define a custom set of listened objects.\n### Set up the object event handler\u200b\nTo **set up** the event handler for an object that inherits from the `Entity` class:\n1. Create a class that inherits from the `BaseEntityEventListener` class.\n2. Decorate the class with the `[EntityEventListener]` attribute and specify the name of the object whose event subscription to execute.\n3. Override the event handler method.\nExample that overrides the event handler method\n/* Event listener of the \"Activity\" schema of \"Object\" type. */  \npublic class ActivityEntityEventListener: BaseEntityEventListener {  \n[EntityEventListener(SchemaName = \"Activity\")]  \n/* Override the handler of the object save event. */  \npublic override void OnSaved(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e) {  \n/* Call the parent implementation. */  \nbase.OnSaved(sender, e);  \n/* Additional actions.  \n... */  \n}  \n}  \n## Asynchronous behavior in the Entity event layer\u200b\nThe additional business logic of an object is time-consuming and executed sequentially. This hurts Creatio's front-end performance, for example, when an object is saved or edited. The **mechanism of asynchronous operation execution** based on the `Entity` event layer solves this problem.\nThe following **components** implement asynchronous behavior in the `Entity` event layer:\n* The `IEntityEventAsyncExecutor` interface. Declares the method that executes operations asynchronously.\n* The `IEntityEventAsyncOperation` interface. Declares the method that launches an asynchronous operation.\n* The `EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs` class. Instances of the class serve as arguments to pass to an asynchronous operation.\n### IEntityEventAsyncExecutor interface\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `Terrasoft.Core.Entities.AsyncOperations.Interfaces.IEntityEventAsyncExecutor` interface is to declare the method that executes operations asynchronously. `ExecuteAsync<TOperation>(object parameters)` is a typed method that launches an operation with parameters. `TOperation` is a configuration class that implements the `IEntityEventAsyncOperation` interface.\n### IEntityEventAsyncOperation interface\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `Terrasoft.Core.Entities.AsyncOperations.Interfaces.IEntityEventAsyncOperation` interface is to declare the method that launches an asynchronous operation. `Execute(UserConnection userConnection, EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs arguments)` is the launch method.\nImportant\nWe do not recommend describing the change logic of the primary object in the class that implements the `IEntityEventAsyncOperation` interface. This can lead to incorrect data creation. We also do not recommend executing lightweight operations (for example, calculating a field value) since creating a separate thread can take more time than executing the operation itself.\n### EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs class\u200b\nThe **purpose** of the `Terrasoft.Core.Entities.AsyncOperations.EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs` class is to provide its instances as arguments to pass to an asynchronous operation.\nThe `EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs` class includes the following **properties** :\n* `EntityId`. The record ID.\n* `EntitySchemaName`. The name of the schema.\n* `EntityColumnValues`. The glossary of current column values of an object.\n* `OldEntityColumnValues`. The glossary of old column values of an object.\n### Implement asynchronous behavior in the event layer\u200b\nTo **implement asynchronous behavior in the event layer** :\n1. Create a class that implements the `IEntityEventAsyncOperation` interface. Implement additional logic that can be run asynchronously in the class.\nView an example of a class that implements additional logic below.\nExample of a class that implements additional logic\n/* The class that implements asynchronous operation calls. */  \npublic class DoSomethingActivityAsyncOperation: IEntityEventAsyncOperation {  \n/* The start method of the class. */  \npublic void Execute(UserConnection userConnection, EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs arguments) {  \n/* ... */  \n}  \n}  \n2. Use a [class factory](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.3&id=15221) in the handler method of the activity object listener.\nThe class factory serves the following **purposes** :\n* Retrieve the instance of the class that implements the `IEntityEventAsyncExecutor` interface.\n* Prepare the parameters.\n* Pass the class that implements additional logic for execution.\nView an example that calls an asynchronous operation in the event layer below.\nExample that calls an asynchronous operation in the event layer\n[EntityEventListener(SchemaName = \"Activity\")]  \npublic class ActivityEntityEventListener: BaseEntityEventListener {  \n/* The handler method of the event after the object is saved. */  \npublic override void OnSaved(object sender, EntityAfterEventArgs e) {  \nbase.OnSaved(sender, e);  \n/* The instance of the class to execute asynchronously. */  \nvar asyncExecutor = ClassFactory.Get <IEntityEventAsyncExecutor> (  \nnew ConstructorArgument(\"userConnection\", ((Entity) sender).UserConnection));  \n/* The parameters to execute asynchronously. */  \nvar operationArgs = new EntityEventAsyncOperationArgs((Entity) sender, e);  \n/* Asynchronous execution. */  \nasyncExecutor.ExecuteAsync <DoSomethingActivityAsyncOperation> (operationArgs);  \n}  \n}",
