  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0All Creatio products\nOn this page\nThe **tile view** shows each record as a set of tiles, each tile representing a field from the corresponding section. A record in tile view usually occupies several rows. Tile view is best used when the list must show a lot of information about each record, as well as images, such as contact profile photos and account logos.\nWhen a record page opens the list is displayed in the additional **vertical view**. In this view, the list data is displayed in a column. Each field of the record corresponds to a certain line in the vertical view. When you toggle between records in the vertical view, the right side of the page displays the detailed information about the selected record.\nIn Creatio you can edit records directly in the list without opening the corresponding pages. The **editable list** is used for fast and frequently changing objects.\nIn this view, the emails and web addresses are displayed as links. Clicking a web address opens a window containing the specified web page. Clicking an email address opens a window where you can create a new message using the default mail client.\nSome other values in the system are also displayed as links to allow quick switching between the records. For example, the value in the **Owner** field of the **Activities** section is displayed as a link to enable switching from the activities list to the activity's owner page.\nnote\nData displayed in the list can be [exported to Excel](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1864) as an *.xlsx file for future processing.  \nUse [data import](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1252) in Creatio to add large numbers of records.\nYou can customize the appearance of a list, its field group, and the data sorting parameters. You can also bring up the summary information for displayed records. To set up lists, use the **View** menu (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 The list setup menu\n![Fig.\u00a01 The list setup menu](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_menu.png)\n## Set up columns\u200b\nAny list can be set up individually for each system user. You can add or remove columns from a list, edit column position, width, and display style.\nYou can display columns of the current object as well as columns from connected objects. For example, in the list of the **Accounts** section, you can display information about the account\u2019s primary contact (such as the primary contact\u2019s position, phone, and email address).\nAlso, the list can display aggregate columns that show the summary information about the subordinate objects. For example, for the \"Account\" object, you can calculate the number of activities by account; for the \"Contact\" object, you can display the date of the last call by the customer, etc.\nnote\nObjects that contain fields with the current object specified are called \"subordinate objects\" or \"objects with the reverse connection.\"\nThe name of the connected column is generated in the format \"Object.Column,\" for example, \"Primary contact.Job title\" or \"Account.City.\" The name of the aggregate column is generated in the format \"Function(Object (the way it is connected)).Column.\" For example, to see the date of the last activity registered for a contact, display the following column in the list: \"Maximum(Activity(by column Contact)).End date.\" The column caption that is displayed in the list can be customized.\nSelect the **Select fields to display** command in the **View** menu to open the columns setup page.\nTo **add** a new column, click ![btn_small_plus.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_small_plus.png):\n* Clicking the button in an empty cell will add a column at that position. In the list mode, you can add columns only if free cells are available in the column setup area. If no free cells are available in the column setup area, a click on ![btn_small_plus00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_small_plus00001.png) in the tile view will add a new row to the column.\n* near the border of any column. To do this, select the column and click ![btn_small_plus00002.png ](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_small_plus00002.png) at the right or left border to add a new column on the right or left of the existing column (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Inserting a column between existing columns\n![Fig. 2 Inserting a column between existing columns](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_setting_add_column_between_others.png)\nTo **set up the display column properties** , select it, and then click ![btn_set_columns_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_set_columns_edit.png). Edit or hide column captions, specify functions and filters for calculating aggregate columns, as well as select the caption display style.\nnote\nYou can only set up the **Hide caption** column if you select in the tile view of the record list.\nTo **hide a column** , select it and click ![btn_set_columns_delete.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_set_columns_delete.png). If there are no columns in the row after the column has been removed in the tile view, then the row will be hidden.\nTo **adjust column width** , drag its left or right border with your mouse (Fig. 3). If no free cells are available in the row, the width of other columns will be modified to accommodate the new column size.\nFig. 3 Changing a column width\n![Fig. 3 Changing a column width](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_setting_width.png)\nTo **move a column** , select it, and then drag it to an empty cell with your mouse (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Moving a column\n![Fig. 4 Moving a column](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_setting_place.png)\nTo **save** column settings, click the **Save** button. The changes will be saved for the current user. If the column settings must be saved for all users that have the same Creatio culture as you, select the **Save for all users** command from the **Save** button menu. The **Save for all users** command is available if the current user has permission for the **List setup for all users** system operation.\nnote\nTo cancel custom column settings in all sections, click the **Restore default settings** button in the user profile. Read more in the [User management](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/setup_and_administration/user_and_access_management/user_management) block of articles.\n### Add a regular list column\u200b\nDescribed below is the procedure for adding current object columns to the list.\nnote\nDisplay the **City** and **Department** columns in the **Contacts** section.\nTo do this:\n1. Open the **Contacts** section\n2. In the **View** menu, select the **Select fields to display** command.\n3. On the column setup page, click the ![btn_small_plus00003.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_small_plus00003.png) button.\n4. Select the column to be displayed, for example, \"City.\" Click the **Select** button (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Selecting a column\n![Fig. 5 Selecting a column](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_summary_select_column.png)\n5. In the column settings area, select the added column and set up its width (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6Widening a column\n![Fig. 6Widening a column](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_setting_width00004.png)\n6. Use the same procedure to add the **Department** column. Use the preview area to optimize the column width (Fig. 7). Click **Save**.\nFig. 7Setting up columns in the Contacts section\n![Fig. 7Setting up columns in the Contacts section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_result.png)\n### Add an aggregated column\u200b\nYou can display aggregate columns of the connected objects. For example, you can get the summary information about the \"Account\" object by the connected \"Activity\" object.\nnote\nDisplay several current contact\u2019s activities connected to each account in the list of the **Accounts** section.\n1. Open the **Accounts** section.\n2. In the **View** menu, select the **Select fields to display** command.\n3. On the column setup page, click the ![btn_small_plus00005.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_small_plus00005.png) button.\n4. In the opened column selection window:\n1. Click the **+** button next to the object name.\n2. In the added field, select an object with the reverse connection, for example, \"Activity (by the **Account** column).\"\n3. In the **Column** field, specify the column of the connected object, for example, \"Quantity.\"\n4. Click the **Select** button (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Selecting an aggregate column\n![Fig. 8 Selecting an aggregate column](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_setting_reverse_connection_select.png)\n5. On the opened page, specify the display and filter parameters for the selected column (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 The column setup page\n![Fig. 9 The column setup page](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_column_setting_reverse_connection_style.png)\n6. Enter the caption for the column to be displayed, for example, \"Number of activities.\"\n7. Specify the filter for data aggregating. For example, to display the number of activities, whose owner is the current user, apply filtering by **Owner** : Current contact.\n8. Click the **Save** button on the column setup page.\n9. Save the column setup parameters.\nAs a result, the accounts list will display the number of activities of the current user for each account.\n## Sort records in a list\u200b\nFor convenience, the section records can be sorted by the values in the selected column in ascending or descending order.\nTo sort records, select the **Sort by** command in the **View** menu. The columns displayed on the section page are listed in the menu. The sorting order (ascending or descending) is indicated next to the name of the column by which sorting is done. For example, all records of the **Activities** section can be sorted by the values in the **Due** column in descending order (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Data sorting\n![Fig. 10 Data sorting](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_sorting_menu.png)\nTo sort records by column, select the **Sort by** command in the **View** menu. Then select the needed column. Selecting the column repeatedly changes the sort order. To display the needed column in the menu, set up the section list.\nIn the list view, you can quickly sort records by clicking the column caption (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Quick data sorting in the list view\n![Fig. 11 Quick data sorting in the list view](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_quick_sorting.png)\nnote\nCreatio automatically saves sorting parameters for each user individually. To return to the default sorting parameters, click **Restore default settings** in the user profile. In this case, all custom settings including sorting will be discarded in all system sections.\n## Set up list summaries\u200b\nSet up the summaries to display the summary information based on the data in the section columns. Select the **Set up summaries** command in the **View** menu to manage summaries (Fig. 12).\nFig. 12 TheSet up summariesoption\n![Fig. 12 TheSet up summariesoption](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_summary_view_button.png)\nThe configured summaries will be displayed in the top right part of the section area (Fig. 13).\nFig. 13 Summaries area in a section\n![Fig. 13 Summaries area in a section](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_summary_display.png)\nSummaries are used to calculate:\n* the total number of records (available for all columns). For example, you can calculate the number of registered customers in the **Contacts** section.\n* the minimum or maximum value in a column (available for numeric columns, date/time columns). For example, in the **Accounts** section, you can find out the last date that a new company was added.\n* The sum or the average value in a column (for numeric columns only). For example, in the **Activities** section, you can display the average activity duration.\nIf the section records are filtered (for example, a [folder](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1018) is selected, or one or more [filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017) are applied), then summaries will be calculated only for the filtered records. For example, if you want to calculate the number of customers from New York, set the corresponding filter and display summaries (Fig. 14).\nFig. 14 Display of summaries for filtered records\n![Fig. 14 Display of summaries for filtered records](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_summary_filter_plus_summary.png)\n### Calculate the number of records\u200b\nTo calculate the number of records:\n1. Open the needed system section.\n2. In the **View** menu, select the **Set up summaries** command.\n3. Select the **Display number of records** checkbox on the opened page.\n4. Click **Save**.\n5. As a result, the total number of system records will be displayed in the summary area.\n### Calculate the results by the column value\u200b\nDescribed below is the procedure of setting up summaries by column values, using the average activity duration value as an example. To set up:\n1. Open the required section, for example, the **Activities** section.\n2. In the **View** menu, select the **Set up summaries** command.\n3. On the opened page, click the **Add** button.\n4. In the list, select the numeric column the summaries should be displayed by, for example, \"Duration (minutes).\" Click the **Select** button (Fig. 15).\nFig. 15 Selecting a column\n![Fig. 15 Selecting a column](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_summary_select_column.png)\nnote\nTo select a column of a subordinate object, click the ![btn_com_expand.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_com_expand.png) button and select the needed subordinate object from the list.\n5. On the summary setup page, specify the display parameters for the summary information:\n1. Select the function from the list for calculating data, for example, \"Average.\"\n2. Enter the caption that will be displayed in the summary area, for example, \"Average duration (minutes),\" and click the ![btn_com_apply.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_com_apply.png) button.\n3. Click the **Save** button to save the user settings (Fig. 16).\nAs a result, the average activity duration will be displayed in the summary area of the **Activities** section.\nFig. 16 Setting up summaries by column values of an object\n![Fig. 16 Setting up summaries by column values of an object](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_summary_setup_example.png)\nTo view summaries for specific records, apply a filter, or select a folder. For example, you can specify the owner, activity category, and the required period.\n### Remove summaries\u200b\nTo remove summaries from the page, click the ![btn_com_quick_filter_cancel.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/btn_com_quick_filter_cancel.png) button next to the record in the summary area (Fig. 17).\nFig. 17Canceling dashboards display\n![Fig.\u00a017Canceling dashboards display](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_results_area_cancel.png)\n## List FAQ\u200b\n### How many columns can I add to a section list?\u200b\nSection lists can be displayed in either \"list\" or \"tile\" view.\nThe maximum number of columns displayed in the **list view** is 24. However, selecting a significant number of columns may be uninformative since the visible area of the list depends on your monitor size. Also, the column width depends on your monitor resolution. Column width may not be sufficient to display the information on smaller monitors (768px, 1024px).\nThe number of columns displayed in the **tile view** is unlimited. However, selecting a significant number of columns affects the overall performance of the system due to increased database loading times.\nWe recommend selecting the optimal number of columns to display the most important data in the list.\n### How do I quickly update the list without reloading the entire section page?\u200b\nIf you make changes to the list (for example, if you modify filtering conditions or sort list entries) It may be necessary to quickly update the list without having to refresh the section page (by pressing the F5 button or using the \"Reload\" command). To update the list data, click on the name of the section (Fig. 18).\nFig. 18Updating the list data in theActivitiessection\n![Fig. 18Updating the list data in theActivitiessection](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_faq_refresh_data.png)\n### When I export data, a message that says \"You have insufficient rights to operate\" pops up\u200b\nYou may have not configured access permission to the **Export list records** [system operation](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=258).\n### How to download detail values?\u200b\nData from the detail can be exported with the **Export to Excel** command available from the actions menu of the detail (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19 Exporting a detail list to Excel\n![Fig. 19 Exporting a detail list to Excel](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_list_setting/scr_list_setting_faq_detail_data_export.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1235)\n[List FAQ](internal:#XREF_65365)\n[Excel data export](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1864)\n[Excel data import](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1252)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Creatio interface overview](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531087/takecourse)",
