  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1Marketing\nOn this page\nUTM parameters are essential tools for tracking the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, understanding lead sources, and enhancing lead generation efforts. Creatio provides robust tools for leveraging UTM parameters in various marketing activities, including email marketing, website tracking, social media integration, and more. This article explores how to best use UTM parameters within the Creatio platform and integrate them with other tracking and lead generation features.\nUTM parameters are parameters added to URLs that help you track the performance of your campaigns across different platforms. These parameters typically include parameters like `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, and `utm_content` that give detailed insights into how visitors arrive at a website and what actions they take.\nFor example, you are running an email campaign to promote a new product launch. You have a newsletter that includes a call-to-action (CTA) button that directs recipients to the product landing page. You want to track how effective this email is at driving traffic and conversions. You can build the following link using URL building tools, such as Campaign URL Builder by Google Analytics: `https://yourwebsite.com/new-product?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=product_launch&utm_term=summer&utm_content=cta_button`. View the parameter breakdown in the table below.\n**Parameter**| **Explanation**  \n---|---  \n`utm_source=newsletter`| Identifies the source of the traffic. For this example, since the traffic is coming from your email newsletter, you set `utm_source=newsletter`.  \n`utm_medium=email`| Specifies the medium through which the link was shared. For this example, because this is an email campaign, you use `utm_medium=email`.  \n`utm_campaign=product_launch`| Names the specific campaign with which the link is associated. For this example, since the purpose of this email is to promote a new product, the campaign name is `utm_campaign=product_launch`.  \n`utm_term=summer`| Identifies the keyword or search term associated with the campaign. For this example, if the product is part of a summer promotion or you are targeting the keyword \"summer\" in your email content, you use `utm_term=summer`. This can help to track seasonal interest or keyword performance related to \"summer.\"  \n`utm_content=cta_button`| Differentiates between similar content or links within the same email or campaign. For this example, if your email contains multiple links, such as a text link and a CTA button, you use `utm_content=cta_button` to track clicks specifically on the button. This helps you determine which element in your email drives the most engagement.  \nUTM parameters are especially crucial when it comes to paid ads. By incorporating UTM parameters into the URLs used in your paid campaigns, you can effectively track the performance and quality of your ads, keywords, and lead forms. This data lets you see which ads are driving the most traffic and conversions. This, in turn, lets you optimize your ad spending and improve ROI.\nAdditionally, UTM parameters are invaluable for A/B testing landing pages. By assigning different UTM parameters to each variation of a page, you can clearly identify which version performs better. This provides critical insights into user behavior and preferences.\nIn Creatio, UTM parameters are particularly valuable for tracking the origin of leads or contacts, measuring the success of email campaigns, integrating data from social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, etc.\n## Take advantage of UTM tracking in Creatio\u200b\n### Track prospect sources and channels using UTM parameters\u200b\nCreatio lets you track lead sources and channels using UTM parameters seamlessly. When a prospect clicks on a link that contains UTM parameters and completes a form on an integrated landing page, Creatio captures the UTM data and attributes it to the corresponding lead or submitted form. This helps to understand which campaigns or platforms are driving the most valuable traffic.\nThe **Populating Contact with Submitted Form's Data** business process available in the **Lead Generation** app automates the collection of this data. When a form is submitted, this process populates the Contact record in Creatio using the submitted information. This includes the **Source** and **Channel** fields based on the UTM parameters. This automation ensures that you have accurate and up-to-date information on the origins of their leads.\nLearn more about the rules that identify the source and channel for prospects in a separate article: [Lead source tracking](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1597#title-2960-9).\n### Utilize UTM parameters in email marketing\u200b\nIn email marketing, UTM parameters are essential for understanding which emails drive the most traffic and conversions. Creatio lets you include UTM parameters in all the links within your emails automatically. This can be done for emails sent manually or through campaign automation workflows. Learn more about the setup process in separate articles: [Create a bulk email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1008#title-1551-3), [Create a trigger email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1506#title-2046-3).\nThis functionality ensures that when a recipient clicks on a link in your email, the action is tracked back to the following:\n* The web analytics of the page the recipient visited. For example, you might see information about the traffic source being email in your Google Analytics account.\n* The lead, submitted form, or contact data where the information about the source, channel, and other parameters is stored after the email is sent and new prospects or leads are generated.\n### Integrate Facebook and LinkedIn with UTM parameters\u200b\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are key channels for generating leads. Creatio supports seamless integration with these platforms, allowing you to set up UTM tracking and capture lead source data efficiently.\n**Facebook Integration** : when setting up Facebook lead generation, you can include UTM parameters or direct source or channel values by assigning default values for form submissions. This will help you to track the source and channel of the prospects generated from Facebook.\n**LinkedIn Integration** : LinkedIn integration can be configured with UTM parameters or direct source or channel values for tracking. This can be done either through default mapping effective for all integrated LinkedIn forms or through the custom mapping that can be different for each of the integrated LinkedIn form.\nLearn more in a separate article: [Create a trigger email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1506#title-2046-3)\n### UTM parameters in web analytics\u200b\nWhen Matomo or Google Analytics integration is enabled, information about UTM parameters can be captured upon form submission from a landing page automatically. If a contact follows a link that contains specific UTM parameters and submits a form on the landing page, the information about these parameters will be included in the submitted form. Based on this information, the **Source** and **Channel** fields in both the submitted form and the corresponding contact record can be populated accordingly. Learn more: [Matomo tracking solution](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2520).\n### Best practices for using UTM parameters\u200b\n* **Consistency in naming conventions**. Use consistent naming conventions for UTM parameters to ensure accurate tracking and reporting. For example, always use `utm_source=google` instead of variations like `utm_source=Google` or `utm_source=GOOGLE`.\n* **Regular monitoring and analysis**. Regularly monitor UTM data in Creatio to adjust your campaigns as needed. Analyze which sources, channels, or campaigns are driving the highly convertible prospects and focus your efforts on those areas.\n* **Integration with the sales data**. Combine UTM data with sales data in Creatio to get a holistic view of the revenue attribution. For example, you can analyze the number of successfully closed opportunities for the prospects from the particular source. This will help you understand which source of prospects is the most effective for your business.\n* **Leveraged automation** : Use Creatio automation features, like including UTM parameters to all links in the email or **Populating Contact with Submitted Form's Data** business process to streamline the capture and utilization of UTM data. Automation reduces manual effort and enhances accuracy.\nUTM parameters in Creatio provide a powerful way to track the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns, understand prospect sources and channels, optimize your lead generation efforts, and improve your marketing ROI. By following the setup and best practices, you can ensure that you are making the most of the UTM tracking capabilities within Creatio.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a trigger email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1506)\n[Lead source tracking](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1597)\n[Set up lead source tracking](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1607)\n[Set up automatic lead registration from social networks](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2499)\n[Set up automatic lead registration from LinkedIn](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2368)\n[Matomo tracking solution](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2520)\n[Add a campaign](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1074)",
