Go to the **Projects** section and open the needed record.\n2. Click ![btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_employees/btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png) in the **List of resources** detail on the **General information** tab.\nProject| The name of the current project.

Planned working time for the project task is stored on the **Resources** detail.  \nActual working time, h| The number of hours actually spent on the project by the employee. This is a non-editable field. The **Calculate actual working time** action automatically calculates the value for this field.  \nWage| The prime cost of the resource for the company. The field is filled in automatically if the external fee specified on the **Wages** detail for the selected contact is valid at the project start date.  \nExternal fee| Cost of employee's work for the customer.

On the **Cash flows** detail on the **Financial indicators** tab, click ![The [Calculate} button](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-12/btn_calculate.png).\nAs a result, the following financial indicators will be calculated:\nRevenue| Expected| Expected revenue amount of the project. The calculation is done based on cash flows of the \"Inflow\" type that have the \"Budgeted\" status.  \n---|---|---  \nActual| Actual revenue amount of the project. The calculation is done based on cash flows of the \"Inflow\" type that have the \"Performed\" status.  \nTotal outflow| Expected| Expected outflow amount of the project. The calculation is done based on cash flows of the \"Inflow\" type that have the \"Budgeted\" status.  \nActual| Actual outflow amount of the project. The calculation is done based on cash flows of the \"Outflow\" type that have the \"Budgeted\" status.  \nTotal cost| Plan| The expected estimated cost of the project for the customer. The value is calculated as a sum of products of expected working time and external fees for the project participants.  \nActual| The actual estimated cost of the project for the customer. The value is calculated as a sum of products of actual working time and external fees for the project participants.  \nPrime cost| Plan| The expected estimated cost of the project for the company. The value is calculated as a sum of products of expected working time and wages for the project participants.  \nActual| The actual estimated cost of the project for the company. The value is calculated as a sum of products of actual working time and wages for the project participants.  \nMargin| Plan| The expected financial result of the project. The value is calculated by subtracting the expected outflows and prime cost from the project's expected revenue.  \nActual| The actual financial result of the project. The value is calculated by subtracting the actual outflows and prime cost from the project's actual revenue.  \nMargin, %| Plan| Percentage of expected margin to expected revenues of the project.  \nActual| Percentage of actual margin to actual revenues of the project.  \nDeviation| Deviation of the obtained values from the planned values. The value is calculated as a difference between actual and expected values, for example, between actual and expected revenues.  \nDeviation, %| Percentage of deviation from the expected value.  \n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a project](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1021)\n[Manage project tasks](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1220)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Project management](https://academy.creatio.com/node/618792/takecourse)",
