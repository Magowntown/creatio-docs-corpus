  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nUse the **Event sub-process** element (Fig. 1) when you need to perform a sequence of tasks whenever a specific event occurs. Event sub-processes can be performed several times during business process execution and can be used for implementing cyclic or repeated activities.\nFig. 1 Event sub-process element with a Message start event and a process task placed inside it\n![Fig.\u00a01 Event sub-process element with a Message start event and a process task placed inside it](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/chapter_process_designer_event_subprocess_element.png)\nFor example, during a sale process, a customer can modify the list of ordered products at any stage of the negotiations, any number of times. In this case, your sales process can include an event sub-process for updating the list of ordered products.\nIn Creatio, an event sub-process is not a typical process element. Please take the following into account when creating event sub-processes:\n* Unlike regular business process elements, the event sub-process is displayed as a separate diagram area. It is not supposed to connect with the rest of the diagram via flows.\n* Any regular elements placed on the event sub-process (e.g., activities, gateways, events and sequence flows) are considered elements of that sub-process and will be executed only if the event sub-process is triggered.\n* In Creatio, the event sub-process must always start with a [**Message** start event.](https://academy.creatio.com#HT_chapter_process_designer_elements_events_message_start) The diagram of the event sub-process will be executed once for each execution of the corresponding [**Throw message** event](https://academy.creatio.com#HT_chapter_process_designer_elements_events_intermediate_throwing_message) in a process instance.\n* The [**Terminate** end event](https://academy.creatio.com#HT_chapter_process_designer_elements_events_terminate) in an event sub-process flow will terminate the entire process. Normally, event sub-processes do not have the **Terminate** event, unless the function of the event sub-process includes terminating the entire process (e.g., the event sub-process handles the cancellation of a sale, etc.).\n## Event sub-process operation\u200b\nActivation| The **Event sub-process** element executes each time the [**Message** start event](https://academy.creatio.com#HT_chapter_process_designer_elements_events_message_start) is triggered by the corresponding [**Throw message** event](https://academy.creatio.com#HT_chapter_process_designer_elements_events_intermediate_throwing_message) (Fig. 2). Same event sub-process can be activated several times in a single process instance.  \n---|---  \nExecution| When the corresponding message is thrown by the process **Throw message** event, the **Message** start event activates its outgoing flow and enables the execution of the other actions in the event sub-process flow.  \nThe event sub-process actions are executed as regular elements of the current business process and do not interrupt its execution.  \nPending user actions of both the event sub-process and the regular process can be performed in any order by the users.  \nUnlike regular [Sub-processes](https://academy.creatio.com#HT_chapter_process_designer_elements_sub_process), event sub-processes do not create a separate process instance in the **Process Log** section. The event sub-process tasks are displayed in the **Process elements** detail of the process log as regular business process tasks, in the order of their execution.  \nFig. 2 Execution diagram of a business process using the Event sub-process element, which was triggered twice during the instance shown\n![Fig.\u00a02 Execution diagram of a business process using the Event sub-process element, which was triggered twice during the instance shown](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_event_sub_process_execution_diagram.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Use sub-processes](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7075)\n[Sub-process element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7041)",
