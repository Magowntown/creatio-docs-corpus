  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2Marketing\nOn this page\nnote\nThe functionality is relevant to Classic UI.\nYou can use **macros** to add sender's and recipient's personal details (name, job title, etc.) when setting up email templates. When sending an email, the macros will be replaced with the corresponding values of the contact page fields (recipient's or sender's).\nYou can add macros to the email's header and preheader, sender's name and sender's email as well as the email's subject and body. It is also possible to personalize the email images with macros.\nYou can use:\n* Basic macros. They let you add data from the recipient's or the sender's contact profile to the template. For example, you can add their full name, job title, etc.\n* [Custom macros](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2055#title-1542-1). They let you add data from the records connected to the recipient's or the sender's contact profile. For instance, you can add an account name from the relevant contact page.\n* Linked entity macros. They let you add data from the linked object's records to the template. For example, you can add the relevant content (a link to the recorded webinar, an event location, etc.) by adding a linked entity macro based on the \"Event participants\" linked object.\n## Macro formatting guidelines\u200b\nMacro formatting in Creatio might differ from external email builders. Emails that contain incorrectly formatted macros will not be sent. To ensure your macros are formatted correctly, follow these guidelines:\n* Enclose macros only in square brackets. For example, [#value#].\n* Divide tables and fields in macro paths only using periods. For example, [#Table.Table.Field#].\n* Define the path to the required field only via linked Creatio entities.\n* Use only Creatio object codes as table or column IDs.\n## Add a basic macro\u200b\nnote\nAdd a salutation for the recipient to the email text.\n1. Open the email template in the Content Designer.\n2. Click the template text in the area where you would like to place the macro.\n3.

Select the \"Salutation\" macro in the \"Recipient\" group and click **Select**.\n5. Save the template\n6. This will add **#Recipient.Title#** macro to the relevant area of the email. When sending the email, the macro will be replaced with the value of the **Recipient\u2019s name** field on the recipient's contact page ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_96180_232)).\nFig. 1 Adding macros to the email subject\n![Fig.\u00a01 Adding macros to the email subject](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_set_macroses/img_section_email_macro_subject.gif)\n#### Common email template macros\u200b\nMacro| Definition  \n---|---  \n**Unsubscribe macros**  \n#Unsubscribe.URL#| Adds the unsubscribe function as a direct link (e.g., \"<http://www.mysite.com/act/unsubscribe>\") to the unsubscribe page.  \n**Recipient information macros**  \n#Recipient.Contact name#| The recipient's first and last name  \n#Recipient.Title#| The recipient's honorifics, for example, \"Mr\" or \"Mrs\".  \n#Recipient.Salutation#| The usual way to greet the recipient, taken from the contact's **Recipient's name** field.
