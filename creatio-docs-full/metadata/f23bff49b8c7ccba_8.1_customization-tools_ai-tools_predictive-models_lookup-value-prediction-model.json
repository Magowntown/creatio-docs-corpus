  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nCreatio provides tools to create and set up machine learning models that predict the lookup field values. The predictions are based on the data available in the record and the previously processed records For example, you can create a model that will predict the customer account category. [Case service agreement and assignee group prediction](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1553) with such an ML model is available in Creatio out of the box.\nImportant\nUsing predictive analysis in Creatio on-site requires additional preliminary setup. Learn more: [Machine learning service](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1935).\n## 1\\. Add a new model\u200b\nExample\nSet up a machine learning model that will predict account categories in the **Accounts** section based on the industry, annual revenue, and the number of employees.\nTo do this, set up and train a lookup prediction model.\nTo add a new ML lookup prediction model:\n1. Open the **ML models** section in the **Studio** workplace.\n2. Click **New** \u2192 **Lookup prediction**.\n3. Fill out the ML model creation mini page (Fig. 1):\n1. **Name** \u2013 the name of the prediction model. The name helps to identify the model in the **ML models** section list and select it when configuring the **Predict data** business process element.\n2. **Type** \u2013 the ML model type. For example, \"Lookup prediction.\" Creatio populates the field automatically when you select the model in the previous step.\n3. **Object** \u2013 the prediction model will predict the records of this object (a section, a detail, or a lookup). For example, \"Account.\"\nFig. 1 The lookup value prediction model mini page\n![Fig.\u00a01 The lookup value prediction model mini page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Service_Tools/set_lookup_prediction_model/chapter_predicting_lookup_value_model_minicard.png)\n4. Click **Next** to save the mini page and open the lookup prediction model setup page.\n## 2\\. Set up the model parameters\u200b\nAfter you fill out the required model fields, specify the parameters:\n1. **What value should be predicted?** \u2013 select the field to be predicted. For example, to predict the account category, select the **Category** field from the list. The list contains all lookup fields of the selected object. Creatio will display the prediction result as one of the **Category** lookup values.\n2. **Which columns does the predicted value depend on?** \u2013 select the \"Object column\" or \"Linked column\" to add columns that determine the behavior algorithms connected to the predicted field. For example, if you normally determine an account's category based on the number of company employees, revenue, and the account's industry, add the **No of employees** , **Annual revenue** , and **Industry** object columns here. Creatio will analyze the historic values of these columns and how the values correlate with the relevant values in the **Category** column.\n3. **Which records should be included in the training dataset?** \u2013 set up a filter Creatio will use to select the training records. For example, narrow down the training data range to only the records that have the account category. To do this, configure the following filter: \"Category is filled in.\"\nYou do not have to specify the filter conditions. Creatio will use all available records for training by default.\nnote\nYou can already save the model and start training it by clicking the **Train model** button at this stage. You will see the training results in the **Expected accuracy** field. Fill out the **What column to use for saving prediction result?** Field to save the prediction results.\n4. **What column to use for saving prediction result?** \u2013 specify where Creatio will store the prediction results. Usually, Creatio saves the results to the column whose value was predicted. If you would rather Creatio did not modify the predicted column, select a different column here.\n5. **Automatic model training settings** \u2013 toggle the switch and set the parameters for automatic model retraining with updated historical data.\n1. Specify the interval between model training sessions in the **Retrain after, days** field. After the specified number of days, Creatio will retrain the model based on historical records that match the filter. The first model training starts when you click the **Train model** button. If you would rather not retrain the model, leave the field blank or enter \"0.\"\n2. Specify the lowest prediction model accuracy threshold in the **Quality metric lower limit** field. When you train the model for the first time, this threshold will determine the minimum acceptable quality that the model needs to reach before Creatio can use it. If the model quality drops below the lower limit, the model is deemed unusable. We recommend setting the quality metric lower limit to at least 0.50. The machine learning model accuracy score ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 (higher is better). Creatio calculates the machine learning model accuracy by dividing the number of successful predictions by the total number of predictions. Learn more about how the prediction accuracy score is calculated in the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy).\n6. Turn on the switch in the **Setting up background update of prediction results** field group to enable daily prediction result updates for the selected records during the minimum load period (Fig. 2). If you turn on the background updates without specifying the filter conditions, the model will update all records.\nnote\nSpecify the period when the batch prediction will take place in the **Maintenance periods** [lookup](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1899).\nFig. 2 The ML lookup prediction model parameters\n![Fig.\u00a02 The ML lookup prediction model parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Service_Tools/set_lookup_prediction_model/chapter_predicting_lookup_value_model_additional_parameters.png)\n## 3\\. Add the advanced settings\u200b\nClick the **Advanced settings** tab if you need to specify additional prediction model parameters.\n1. Set up a query that selects additional columns used for value prediction in the **Advanced tools to add columns** field group. Note that the query setup requires coding. Learn more: [Creating data queries for the machine learning model](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15756&anchor=title-1471-9/).\n2. Creatio populates the values in the **Advanced model parameters** field group (Fig. 3) automatically. You can edit the values, if necessary.\n1. **Minimum training record count** \u2013 the minimum number of records needed to train a model.\n2. **Maximum training record count** \u2013 the maximum number of records needed to train a model.\n3. **Predicted value selection method** \u2013 can be \"ML Engine Significance\" or \"Maximum probability.\"\n* \"**ML Engine Significance** \" \u2013 default method. If selected, Creatio will determine the prediction quality based on the ML mechanism. If the prediction quality is sufficiently high, Creatio will save the predicted value to the relevant field.\n* \"**Maximum probability** \" \u2013 enables a custom predicted value selection method. If you select this option, a new field will appear:\n4. **Lower limit of probability for predicted value selection** \u2013 the minimum probability where the predicted value will still be saved automatically. If the predicted value is below this threshold, Creatio will not populate the field automatically. However, Creatio will display the prediction when you fill out the field manually.\nFig. 3 The advanced ML lookup prediction model parameters\n![Fig.\u00a03 The advanced ML lookup prediction model parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Service_Tools/set_lookup_prediction_model/chapter_predicting_lookup_value_model_advanced_parameters.png)\n3. Click **Save**. To start training a lookup prediction model, click **Train model**.\n## Prediction results\u200b\nThis will add a new ML model to Creatio.\nIf you set up batch prediction, the model will update predictions for the selected records daily during the maintenance period without the use of business processes.\nSet up a business process with the **Predict data** element to gain complete control over what records to predict and when. If a business process triggers the model, it will predict and populate the values for the needed records. Learn more: [Implement prediction models](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1950).\nThe account category prediction model will analyze the values in the **No of employees** , **Annual revenue** , and **Industry** columns of accounts with the populated **Category** column. The more data it analyzes, the higher the quality of the metric.\nOnce the quality is high enough, the model will predict the value in the **Category** field based on the values in the **No of employees** , **Annual revenue** , and **Industry** fields. Creatio will automatically populate the lookup fields with predicted values, sorted by probability.\nDepending on the probability ratio, Creatio distinguishes among the following prediction types:\n* certain prediction\n* near-certain prediction\n* weak prediction\n### Certain prediction\u200b\nA certain prediction is a prediction with an evident leader. In this case, Creatio automatically populates the field with the predicted value, and the ![btn_strong_prediction.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_page/btn_strong_prediction.png) button appears next to it. Save the page if the field is populated correctly.\nClick the ![btn_strong_prediction00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_page/btn_strong_prediction00001.png) button to display all possible predictions and their probabilities with the most probable item highlighted.\nIf you modify the field, the ![btn_middle_prediction.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_page/btn_middle_prediction.png) button will appear. Click the button to display all predictions.\n### Near certain prediction\u200b\nIf there are multiple values with close probabilities, Creatio will not populate the field, and the ![btn_middle_prediction00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_page/btn_middle_prediction00002.png) button will appear next to it. Click the button to display the list of predictions and their probabilities.\n### Weak prediction\u200b\nA weak prediction occurs when Creatio cannot compare the historical data to the data used for analysis. Creatio does not populate the field with a weak prediction, and the ![btn_weak_prediction.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_page/btn_weak_prediction.png) button appears next to it.
