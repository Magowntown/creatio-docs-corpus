  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2All Creatio products\nOn this page\nAn event audience in Creatio is a list of event participants, i. e. contacts connected to the event. Keep track of the event audience responses in marketing campaigns, business processes, dashboards, and on the event page.\nManage the list of event participants in the **Audience** tab:\n* add contacts and contact folders\n* remove participants\n* update the event responses\n* set up columns and apply filters.\n## Add audience\u200b\n1. Go to the **Audience** tab on the relevant event page.\n2. Click ![The \"+\" button](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-11/btn_plus_0.png) (Fig. 1) on the **Audience** detail. This will open a contact list.\nFig. 1 Add audience\n![Fig.\u00a01 Add audience](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-11/scr_events_add_audience_click.png)\n3. Select the desired records manually or filter them by set conditions in the contact list. After that, click **Import** and select the import option from the menu:\n* If you applied the **filter conditions** or selected a **folder** to import, click **Import by filter** (Fig. 2).\n* If you selected the desired records **manually** , click **Import selected**.\n4. Click **Close**.\nFig. 2 Import by filter\n![Fig.\u00a02 Import by filter](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-11/event_add_audience_by_filter.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will import the desired records to the event audience and display them on the **Audience** tab of the event page.\nAlternatively, set up a [marketing campaign](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1074) to add the event audience automatically. Use a special element to add the campaign audience to the event audience. Learn more: [The **Add to event** element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1487#title-347-100).\n## Track event responses\u200b\nAn event response is the status of an event participant, such as whether they planned to participate, participated, canceled their participation, or did not respond. View the responses on the **Audience** tab next to each record.\nnote\nCreate a lookup named \"Response in events\" and add the desired statuses as values to change the list of available response statuses. This lookup is not available by default.\nTrack the event responses and analyze the financial indicators in the **Dashboards** section view.\nThe **Dashboards** view includes the following tabs:\n1. The **Audience** tab. This tab contains event participant statistics.\nnote\nCreatio will apply the filters set in the section to all dashboards on the tab.\nAudience by response| A diagram with the event audience grouped by their responses.  \n---|---  \nEvent participants with leads| An indicator displaying the number of event participant contacts with leads. The indicator only shows contacts with the \"Participation confirmed,\" \"Participated,\" and \"Planned\" responses.  \nEvent participants without leads| An indicator displaying the number of event participant contacts without leads. The indicator only shows contacts with the \"Participation confirmed,\" \"Participated,\" and \"Planned\" responses.  \n2. The **Event totals** tab. This tab contains event summary statistics.\nnote\nCreatio will apply the filters set in the section to all dashboards on the tab except for the **Upcoming events** block.\nExpected budget| An indicator displaying the total expected event budget, in the base currency.  \n---|---  \nActual cost| An indicator displaying the total actual event costs, in the base currency.  \nExpected revenue| An indicator displaying the total expected event revenue, in the base currency.  \nActual revenue| An indicator displaying the total actual event revenue, in the base currency.  \nUpcoming events| A list of 5 events that start today or later. The data is sorted by date in ascending order. The closest event appears at the top of the list.  \nEvents by type| A diagram with the events grouped by their type.  \n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Plan marketing events](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1007)",
