Installed from the app store. Such an app is developed using a high-level language and compiled into native OS code to ensure the best performance. It cannot be transferred among mobile platforms easily.  \nMobile web app| A specialized website adapted to specific mobile devices. The app is platform independent. This requires a constant network connection, as the app is physically hosted not on the mobile device but on a dedicated server.  \nHybrid app| A mobile app wrapped in a native container. Installed from the app store. Such app is developed using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript languages. These apps are easy to transfer among mobile platforms, but have slightly lower performance compared to native apps.  \n## Creatio mobile app architecture\u200b\nThe **Creatio mobile app** is a remote workplace that provides quick access to customer data, calendar, mobile mailing list, etc.\nThe Creatio mobile app is available for download on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobile-creatio/id708432450?l=pl) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creatio.mobileapp) on mobile devices that meet the requirements. Learn more: [System requirements for mobile devices](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1920&anchor=title-773-1) (user documentation).\n### Implementation\u200b\nView the mobile app architecture chart in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MobileApplicationArchitecture/7.18/scr_mobile_app_architecture.png)\nThe main framework of the Creatio mobile app is Flutter. Learn more: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flutter_\\(software\\)&oldid=1183662863).\nFlutter framework **features** :\n* Performance of apps developed using this framework is close to native apps (native-like).\n* The mobile apps developed using this framework have the advantages of hybrid apps when it comes to using common code for iOS and Android mobile platforms.\nFlutter framework **benefits** :\n* A large number of dashboards to build the UI.\n* Access to the mobile device programming UI (API) that interacts with the database, file system, mobile device sensors. For example, camera.\nLearn more: official [vendor documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).\nThe core of the Creatio mobile app is a **set of libraries** (Creatio libs). The connection between Flutter and the mobile app core is implemented using plugins developed in Java (Android) or Objective C (iOS). The main part of the library code is implemented in Java and is cross-platform. Cross-platform functionality is ensured using the J2ObjC utility that converts Java code into Objective C code. Learn more: official [vendor documentation](https://developers.google.com/j2objc/).\nLibraries let you execute the following actions:\n* Perform synchronization by communicating with the Creatio server.\n* Work with the file system.\n* Work with metadata received upon synchronization, etc.\n**Metadata** are configuration files the app retrieves as part of synchronization with the Creatio server and stores locally in the device file system.\nMetadata includes:\n* Creatio mobile app manifest.\n* Schemas that extend the app capabilities.\n* Settings of sections that the Mobile App Wizard creates.\nnote\nThe app also uses the Apache Cordova framework during the functionality transition to the Flutter framework. Learn more: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apache_Cordova&oldid=1183120971).\n### Workflow\u200b\nThe store-published Creatio mobile app published is a set of modules needed to synchronize with the desktop Creatio application server. The desktop Creatio application stores all settings and data needed for the mobile app. View the mobile app workflow in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MobileApplicationArchitecture/8.1/scr_mobile_app_working_scheme.png)\nAfter you install the app into the mobile device and set the connection parameters to the Creatio server, the app receives metadata (app structure, system data) and data from the server.\nThe advantage of this workflow is compatibility with all existing Creatio products. Each product and each customer website can contain its own set of mobile app settings, business logic, and even UI. All a mobile user needs to do is install the mobile app and synchronize it with the Creatio website.\n### Operation modes\u200b\nOperation modes of mobile apps\nMode| Description  \n---|---  \nHybrid mode| Hybrid mode is designed for working with data and is activated automatically if a stable connection to the Creatio server is unavailable. This mode lets you create new records and work with schedules. It is also possible to manage 10 section records with which you have interacted recently.  \nOnline| Online mode requires an Internet connection. In this mode, the user works directly with the main application that works as Creatio server. Configuration changes are synchronized automatically in real-time.  \nOffline| For offline mode, an Internet connection is only required for the preliminary import and synchronization. When you use this mode, the app saves data locally to the mobile device. You must synchronize data with the Creatio server manually to receive configuration changes and data updates.  \nTo change the operation mode **for a single user** :\n1. **Open the System settings section**. To do this, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) \u2192 **System setup** \u2192 **System settings**.\n2. **Open the Mobile application operation mode** (`MobileApplicationMode code`) system setting.\n3. **Fill out the system setting properties**.\nProperty| Property value  \n---|---  \nDefault value| Online or offline  \nSave value for current user| Select the checkbox  \n4. **Save the changes**.\nTo change the operation mode **for all users** :\n1. **Open the System settings section**. To do this, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) \u2192 **System setup** \u2192 **System settings**.\n2. **Open the Mobile application operation mode** (`MobileApplicationMode code`) system setting.\n3. **Fill out the system setting properties**.\nProperty| Property value  \n---|---  \nDefault value| Online or offline  \nSave value for current user| Clear the checkbox  \n4. **Save the changes**.\n5. Make sure that users **have permission to change the system setting**.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots.en/MobileApplicationArchitecture/scr_mobile_sys_setting.png)\n### Synchronization\u200b\nSynchronization with the Creatio server performs different tasks based on app operation mode. In online mode, synchronization is only needed to receive configuration changes. In offline mode, synchronization is needed to receive updates and send / receive changed or new data. View the general synchronization workflow below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MobileApplicationArchitecture/8.1/scr_mobile_app_synch_scheme.png)\nFirst, the app performs authentication. The current active session is destroyed on the server. Next, the app requests data from the server to generate a difference. The app analyzes this data and requests modified or new configuration schemas. After the schemas are loaded, the app retrieves system data, which includes cached lookups (also known as simple lookups), system settings, etc. Then, data is exchanged with the server.\nThe mobile app implements one more synchronization stage called \"Actualize data.\" If this functionality is enabled, it is the last synchronization step. The app compares data available on the server with local data. If a difference is found, the app downloads missing data or deletes outdated data. This mechanism resolves issues that can occur when redistributing access permissions or deleting data from the server. To **enable data actualization** :\n1. **Open the mobile app manifest**.\n2. **Go to the** `SyncOptions` **schema section** \u2192 `ModelDataImportConfig`.\n3. **Set the** `IsAdministratedByRights` **property** to `true`.\n## Export data in batch mode\u200b\nBy default, the mobile app sends each change to data one by one. Thus, one change makes at least one request to the server. If the number of changes is large, executing such requests can take time.\nThe app lets you send data in batch mode, which accelerates data upload to the server significantly.\nTo **enable the batch mode of data sending** :\n1. **Open the mobile app manifest**.\n2. **Move to the** `SyncOptions` **schema section**.\n3. **Set the** `UseBatchExport` **property** to `true`.\n**As a result** , all user changes will be grouped into multiple batch requests by operation type. The available operation types are insert, update, and delete.\n## Life cycle of mobile app pages\u200b\nWhen you navigate through the mobile app, Creatio executes multiple steps for each page. The **stages** in the life cycle of mobile app pages are as follows:\n* Open. Read more >>>\n* Close. Read more >>>\n* Upload. Read more >>>\n* Return to the page. Read more >>>\nThe time from loading a page into the memory of a mobile device to its final unload from memory is called the page life cycle. **Page events** are provided for each life cycle stage. The events let you extend the functionality. The base events are as follows:\n* initialize view\n* finish class initialization\n* load a page\n* load a data\n* close a page\nSince a phone screen can display only a single page and a tablet screen can display a single page in portrait mode and two in landscape mode, the page life cycle for phone and tablet is different.\n### Open a page\u200b\nWhen you open a page the first time, the mobile app loads the scripts needed for the page work. Next, the app initializes the controller and creates the view.\nView the generation sequence of page open events in the table below.\nEvent| Description  \n---|---  \ninitializeView| Initializes views  \npageLoadComplete| Completes page loading  \nlaunch| Initiates data loading  \n### Close a page\u200b\nWhile closing a page, Creatio removes its view from the object model and removes the controller from device memory.\nCreatio closes the page in the following cases:\n* When you click the **Back** button. In this case, the last page is deleted.\n* When you move to another section. In this case, previously opened pages are deleted.\n`pageUnloadComplete` event finishes page closure.\n### Unload a page\u200b\nCreatio unloads a page when you move to another page in the same section. The current page becomes inactive. It can remain visible on the device screen. For example, if you open a page from the list on a tablet, the list page remains visible. In the same case on the phone, the list page becomes invisible but remains in memory. There is a difference between unloading the page and closing it.\n`pageUnloadComplete` event (the same as the page close event) unloads the page.\n### Return to a page\u200b\nThe app returns to the previously unloaded page when you click the **Back** button.\n`pageLoadComplete` event returns to the page.\nImportant\nThe app can use only one page instance. Therefore, if you open two identical pages one by one, the `launch` event handler is executed again when you return to the first page. Keep it in mind during development.\n## Background configuration update in a mobile app\u200b\nCreatio mobile app implements a synchronization mechanism for the app structure that can work automatically in the background. To manage this process, use the **Update checks frequency** (`MobileAppCheckUpdatePeriod` code) system setting.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots.en/MobileApplicationArchitecture/scr_mobile_sys_setting.png)\nThis setting sets the time in hours after which the mobile app can request configuration changes from Creatio. If set to 0, the app always downloads configuration updates when they appear.\n### Conditions to run the synchronization\u200b\nThe conditions to run the structure synchronization in the background are as follows:\n* The mobile device uses the iOS or Android platform.\n* The synchronization was not run previously.\n* More time has passed since the structure was last synchronized than the time specified in the **Update checks frequency** (`MobileAppCheckUpdatePeriod` code) system setting.\n* The device launches or activates the app, i.e., the app was previously minimized or you access it from another app.\nIf changes are received during the structure update, the app is restarted automatically to apply them when you minimize the app or move to another app.\n### Special features on different platforms\u200b\n1. Background mode on the **Android** platform is implemented using a parallel running service. This approach ensures that a running synchronization is guaranteed to finish even if you manually unload the app from the device memory.\n2. On the **iOS** platform, the app works in the main `webView`, while the background synchronization uses the second `webView`. This ensures that the user can continue working with the app while the structure synchronization is in progress. Unlike the Android platform, the synchronization can be interrupted when you unload the app manually or if the iOS platform unloads it.\nThe iOS app uses `WKWebView` instead of `UIWebView`. As such, the app uses Cordova 6.1.1 framework and supports only iOS 12 and later.\n`WKWebView` features are as follows:\n* Do not use absolute paths for resources, scripts, iframe containers, etc.\n* Do not use cross-domain URLs for resources, scripts, iframe containers, etc.\n* `localStorage` data is saved when switching to `WKWebView`.\n* We do not recommend using an iframe.\nLearn more: official [vendor documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2018/08/01/future-cordova-ios-webview.html).\nIf you need to insert a link to a local file into the page, convert the path using the `Terrasoft.util.toUrlScheme()` method.\nExample that inserts a link to a local file into the page\nthis.element.setStyle('background-image', 'url(\"' + Terrasoft.util.toUrlScheme(value) +'\")');  \nView the link examples below.\n* Incorrect link\n* Converted link\nfile:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/DE283C57-94BE-4116-980A-020C271D9871/Documents/BPMonline700/Downloads/afc78721-ed5f-439e-9a24-69bf56d32610/afc78721-ed5f-439e-9a24-69bf56d32610  \napp://localhost/_app_file_/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/DE283C57-94BE-4116-980A-020C271D9871/Documents/BPMonline700/Downloads/afc78721-ed5f-439e-9a24-69bf56d32610/afc78721-ed5f-439e-9a24-69bf56d32610  \nFeatures of the `inappbrowser` plugin are as follows:\n* All paths must be relative and located inside the website root folder.\n<img src=\"images/2.jpg\">  \n* Do not use cross-domain URLs for resources, scripts, iframe containers, etc.\n<img src=\"https://www.worldometers.info/img/worldometers-logo.gif\">  \n<img src=\"file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/DE283C57-94BE-4116-980A-020C271D9871/Documents/BPMonline700/Downloads/afc78721-ed5f-439e-9a24-69bf56d32610/pic.jpg\">  \n* Set the absolute path when you open the website.\ncordova.InAppBrowser.open(\"file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/DE..9871/Documents/BPMonline700/Downloads/afc78721-ed5f-439e-9a24-69bf56d32610/index.html\", \"_blank\");  \nOpening the website using the `inappbrowser` plugin has features similar to the `WKWebView` features.\n## Resolve synchronization conflicts automatically\u200b\nDuring synchronization of a mobile app that runs in offline mode, situations when Creatio cannot save the transferred data can occur due to the following reasons:\n* A record was merged with another duplicate record in Creatio and therefore no longer exists.\n* A record was removed from Creatio.\nThe mobile app handles every conflict automatically.\n### Merge duplicates\u200b\nView the procedure to resolve conflicts caused by records deleted from Creatio due to duplicate merging in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MobileApplicationArchitecture/8.1/scr_duplicates_resolving_schema.png)\nDuring the synchronization, the app first retrieves data about the merged records since the last synchronization from the server. Specifically, which records were deleted, and which records replaced them. If no errors occur during the export, Creatio executes the import. If an error related to the foreign key exception (`Foreign Key Exception`), or an error related to a record not being found on the server (`Item Not Found Exception`) occurs, the following procedure to resolve this conflict is executed:\n* Creatio searches the exported data for columns that contain the old record.\n* Creatio replaces the old record in the found columns with the new record into which data was merged.\nThen the record is re-sent to Creatio. When the import finishes and information about merged duplicates becomes available, the old records are deleted locally.\n### Record not found\u200b\nWhen the server returns an error about the record the user modified not being found in Creatio, the app executes the following actions:\n1. Check if the record exists in the list of records deleted as part of the duplicate merge.\n2. If the record is not in the list of deleted records, delete the record locally.\n3. Remove information about this record from the synchronization log.\nThus, the app considers this conflict resolved and continues data export.\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Creatio Mobile app (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobile-creatio/id708432450?l=pl)\n[Creatio Mobile app (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creatio.mobileapp)\n[Flutter framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flutter_%28software%29&oldid=1183662863) (Wikipedia)\n[Official Flutter framework documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)\n[Official J2ObjC utility documentation](https://developers.google.com/j2objc/)\n[Apache Cordova framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apache_Cordova&oldid=1183120971) (Wikipedia)",
