  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nUse the **Application Hub** section to manage Creatio apps and add-ons. In Creatio, apps are function blocks that solve business problems. For example, an app can be a set of request management tools. An app can consist of one or more content packages. Packages are added automatically when you create a new app.\nThe **Application Hub** section lets you:\n* View the index of installed apps.\n* Create and set up a custom app manually. Read more >>>\n* Create and set up a custom app using AI. Read more >>>\n* Install Marketplace apps for permanent or trial use. Read more >>>\n* Install previously created and configured apps from file. Read more >>>\n* Deploy apps. Read more >>>\n* Download apps. Read more >>>\n* Update apps from Marketplace. Read more >>>\n* Uninstall apps. Read more >>>\n## Create an app manually\u200b\nYou can create apps of any complexity in a single place using the **Application Hub** , which lets you streamline the development process as much as possible. Apps can include:\n* sections that are displayed as navigation menu items and comprise various custom UI elements\n* various pages, e. g, lists, form pages, dashboards\n* business processes\n* custom REST and SOAP service integrations\n* other schema types that are a part of Creatio configuration, e. g., objects, data bindings, SQL scripts, etc.\nBefore you create an app, **set your maintainer name** to the \"Publisher\" (\"Maintainer\" code) system settings. We do not recommend developing an app using the \"Customer\" maintainer because such apps can become editable on development environments regardless of your intentions.\nTo create a new app manually:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 \"Application management\" \u2192 \"Application Hub.\"\n2. Click **New application** (Fig. 1). This opens a window.\nFig. 1 Add an app\n![Fig.\u00a01 Add an app](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/add_new_app_1.png)\n3. Select a new app template based on your business goals (Fig. 2):\n* **Records & Business processes**. Contains Freedom UI section schemas. The Freedom UI section is displayed in a separate workplace.\n* **Dashboards**. Contains Home Page schemas of page type. The page is displayed in a separate workplace.\n* **Custom**. An empty template that contains a package with no configuration element schemas.\nFor example, select \"Records & Business processes\" to add a list and form page to the app automatically.\nnote\nIf you want to install an existing app, select \"[Install from file](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2444&anchor=title-2304-2)\" or \"[Marketplace powered](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2444&anchor=title-2304-1).\" Also, you can select \"Customer 360\" and \"Case Management\" to install these apps quickly if you do not have them.\nFig. 2 Select an app template\n![Fig.\u00a02 Select an app template](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/academy_en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/8.1/choose_type_new_app.png)\n4. Click **Select** to confirm the template. This opens a window.\n5. Specify the app properties. You can review or change it whenever you need. Learn more about the app properties in a separate article: [Set up the app properties](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2405).\n1. Select the app icon by clicking the arrows or using the scroll wheel.\n2. Select the app icon color.\n3. Enter the app name in the **PLEASE NAME YOUR APPLICATION** field. The app name must be unique. This is a required field.\n4. Edit the app code if needed.\nnote\nApp content includes source code that contains macros. When you create an app, Creatio sets the macros to app property values.\n6. Select **Link to an existing object** to use an existing object in the app and transfer your previous customizations to Freedom UI. Otherwise Creatio adds a new object for the app.\n7. Click **Create** (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 App properties\n![Fig.\u00a03 App properties](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_populate_fields_new_app.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will add the app to the **Application Hub** section (Fig. 4). The app will contain the elements included in the template. For example, a list page and form page. You might need to add new sections to workplaces before users can start working with the app.\nFig. 4 Configuration of the new app\n![Fig.\u00a04 Configuration of the new app](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_new_app_advanced_settings.png)\nTo view the results or test the app in operation, click **Run app**. You can also use this option to preview the improvements you make to the app.\nSince Creatio version 8.1.2, you can **edit the self-developed app** on other environments if the maintainer of the environment and maintainer of the app or package match and the \"Allow to edit your own apps from an archive\" (\"CanEditOwnAppsFromArchive\" code) system setting is turned on.\n## Create an app using AI\u200b\nYou can accelerate Creatio app development drastically using AI. Enter the app description and the AI will create an app, including objects, pages, sections, and columns.\nThis functionality is available out of the box in **Creatio cloud**.\nTo create a new app using AI:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 \"Application management\" \u2192 \"Application Hub.\"\n2. Click **New application**. This opens a window.\n3. Select **AI generated** \u2192 **Select**. This opens a window (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5 Create an app using AI\n![Fig.\u00a05 Create an app using AI](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_create_an_app_using_ai.png)\n4. Specify the app properties. You can review or change it whenever you need. Learn more about the app properties in a separate article: [Set up the app properties](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2405).\n1. Select the app icon by clicking the arrows or using the scroll wheel. OpenAI does not use the icon as part of the app generation.\n2. Select the app icon color. OpenAI does not use the color as part of the app generation.\n3. Enter the app name in the **PLEASE NAME YOUR APPLICATION** field. OpenAI uses this value as the name of the app and the main app section.\n5. Describe the app structure in the **DESCRIBE WHAT IT'S FOR** field. OpenAI generates the app in the language of the prompt. Learn more about making the most effective prompts: AI prompt guidelines.\n6. Click **Generate with AI**.\n7. Wait until OpenAI finishes generating the app.\nAs a result, OpenAI will create a new app based on your prompts. You will be able to customize it further similarly to any other app. The generated app will include the following:\n* demo data\n* dynamic cases\n* progress bars on form pages\n* customizable mini page for adding lookup and expanded list records\n### AI prompt guidelines\u200b\nOpenAI generates apps based on any prompt, but the results might not always be close to your business vision. Follow these guidelines to ensure the result fulfills your business goals as much as possible:\n1. Describe **only the app structure** in the prompt, i. e., objects, lookup objects, sections, pages, and fields. Avoid marketing text, internal jargon, or functionality unrelated to the app structure, for example, Jira integration.\n2. Describe the app structure **thoroughly and explicitly** if you want to get precise results. AI can add details, for example, fields, to the app if your prompt is short or vague.\n3. Describe the **data model** if you want to have the most control over the results.\n**For example** : An application for selling travel packages. I need to track: travel package name, stage, customer's full name, phone number, email, number of adults, number of children over 3 years old, destination, trip start date, trip end date, number of nights, estimated budget. Also, add the table of preferences (field: preferences(text)) and table of recommended hotels (column: hotel name(text)) for each travel package.\n## Install an app from Marketplace\u200b\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 \"Application Management\" \u2192 \"Application Hub.\"\n2. Click **New application** (Fig. 6). This opens a window.\nFig. 6 Add an app\n![Fig.\u00a06 Add an app](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_app_hub_new_app.png)\n3. Select **Marketplace powered** \u2192 **Select**. You will be redirected to the Creatio Marketplace website.\n4. Log in under your credentials. If you do not have an account, sign up and log in to your account.\n5. Select the app to install and look through its characteristics and support conditions. Click **Install** if the app requirements match your Creatio configuration. You will be redirected to the Creatio App Installation Wizard in the **Application Hub**.\n6. Click **Install** on the Wizard page. The installation might take several minutes to finish. Wait for the process to complete before taking any further action.\nAs a result, Creatio will add the app to the **Application Hub** section.\nFig. 7 New app in the Application Hub section\n![Fig.\u00a07 New app in the Application Hub section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_appliication_hub_new_app_installed.png)\nTo view the results or test the app in operation, open the app and click **Run app**.\nIf something goes wrong during the installation, you can always download the installation log and restore your Creatio configuration to the state before the app was installed in a single click.\nFig. 8 App installation error\n![Fig.\u00a08 App installation error](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_app_installation_error.png)\n## Install an app from a file\u200b\nYou can also install an app **from a *.zip or *.gz file**. This method can be more convenient for Creatio on-site users who have limited access to external requests. To do this:\n1. Open the needed app \u2192 the **Packages** tab \u2192 download the Marketplace app files.\n2. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 \"Application Management\" \u2192 \"Application Hub.\"\n3. Click **New application**. This opens a window.\n4. Select **Install from file** \u2192 **Select**.\n5. Click **Select file** on the page of the Marketplace App Installation Wizard and specify the app file path.\nOnce you select the file, the installation will run automatically.\n## Install an app into an environment that uses a balancer\u200b\nIf you use a load balancer to ensure fault tolerance of your Creatio application, the install process for apps differs. Install an app from a file into one Creatio instance, then transfer settings to other instances. Learn more in a separate article: [Compile an app on a web farm](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2410).\n## Deploy an app\u200b\nYou can transfer apps between trial Creatio environments in the Application Hub without downloading apps. For example, this is useful for setting up demo websites and conducting presentations.\nTo **transfer** an app:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 \"Application Management\" \u2192 \"Application Hub.\"\n2. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/scr_button_to_delete_app.png) button in the bottom right of the app icon \u2192 \"Deploy\" (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Deploy the app\n![Fig.\u00a09 Deploy the app](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_application_hub_deploy_app.png)\n3. Select the target site \u2192 **Deploy**.\nFig. 10 Deployment parameters\n![Fig.\u00a010 Deployment parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/scr_application_hub_deploy_app_parameters.png)\nAs a result, Creatio will add the app to the **Application Hub** section of the target website.\nIf something goes wrong during the installation, you can always download the installation log and restore your Creatio configuration in a single click.\n## Download an app\u200b\nYou can download custom and Marketplace apps as archives to transfer them to different environments. To **download** an app:\n1. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right \u2192 \"Application Management\" \u2192 \"Application Hub.\"\n2. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/scr_button_to_delete_app.png) button in the bottom right of the app icon \u2192 \"Export\" (Fig. 11) and wait for the process to complete.\nFig. 11 Download an app\n![Fig.\u00a011 Download an app](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_hub_download_app.png)\nAs a result, the browser will download the *.zip archive that contains all the app files to your machine.\nWhen you download an app, Creatio saves any data you entered into the app as well as the following app properties:\n* icon\n* color\n* name\n* description\nCreatio applies this data when you install the app into a different environment. If you install an app from an archive, Creatio creates an app automatically. An app name and code are based on the *.zip or *.gz archive name, the date specified in the app name is the archive downloading date.\n## Update an app from Marketplace\u200b\nDevelopment and pre-production environments of Creatio in the cloud can notify system administrators (users who belong to the \"System administrators\" role) about new versions of installed Marketplace apps.\nOut of the box, the \"Check Marketplace apps update availability\" business process checks for updates of installed Marketplace apps daily. You can change how often to check for updates by editing the process.\nIf an update exists, Creatio displays the following notifications:\n* system message in the **Notification panel** (Fig. 12)\nFig. 12 System message in the Notification panel\n![Fig.\u00a012 System message in the Notification panel](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_update_notification_panel.png)\n* **Update** icon on the app tile in the **Application Hub** (Fig. 13)\nFig. 13 Update icon on the app tile in the Application Hub\n![Fig.\u00a013 Update icon on the app tile in the Application Hub](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_update_app_hub.png)\n* **Update** button in the **No-Code Designer** (Fig. 14)\nFig. 14 Update button in the No-Code Designer\n![Fig.\u00a014 Update button in the No-Code Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_update_no_code_designer.png)\nYou can **enable notifications for production environments** deployed in the cloud or on-site with access to external networks. To do this, turn on the \"AppsFeatures.CheckApplicationUpdates\" feature for a production environment. Instructions: [Change the status of an additional feature for all users](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15631&anchor=title-3459-3) (developer documentation).\nImportant\nBefore you update a Marketplace app on a production environment, make sure the Marketplace app can be updated successfully on a pre-production environment.\nTo **update a Marketplace app** :\n1. **Open the app update page**. You can do it in several ways:\n* Click the system message in the **Notification panel**\n* Open the **Application Hub** section \u2192 ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/scr_button_to_delete_app.png) button in the bottom right of the app icon \u2192 **Update**\n* Open the app page in the **No-Code Designer** \u2192 **Update**\nThis opens the **App update** window in the **Application Hub** section (Fig. 16).\n2.
