  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nThe **Process file** process element lets you automate file operations in business processes (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 The Process file process element\n![Fig.\u00a01 The Process file process element](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/BPM_Tools/process_file/process_file_element_1.png)\nThe **Process file** element lets you:\n* Read and copy files from the **Attachments** details of Creatio records.\n* Get files from process parameters.\n* Generate Word reports.\nThere are several ways to take advantage of the read or generated files:\n* Use them during the business process runtime. For example, send the files as email attachments.\n* Save them to the **Attachments** detail of other records (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Setting up the Process file element\n![Fig.\u00a02 Setting up the Process file element](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/BPM_Tools/process_file/process_file_new_report_generate.gif)\n## Process files in a business process\u200b\n### Example setup for object files\u200b\nExample\nCopy 10 most recent files on the **Attachments** detail from one contact to a different contact's detail.\nSet up the **Process file** element the following way (Fig. 3).\n1. **What is the source of the file?** \u2013 select \"Attachments and notes of the object\" to let the element read the files on the **Attachments** detail.\n2. **Which object to receive file from?** \u2013 select a Creatio object that contains the relevant files. In this case the relevant object is \"Contact attachment.\"\n3. **How to filter records?** \u2013 set the necessary filters and specify the number of records to read. In this case, select the attachments of James Smith and specify 10 records. This way, the element will use the first 10 records that correspond to the sorting order (see below). Read more about working with filters in the [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017) article.\n4. **How to sort records?** \u2013 specify the sorting order. For example, changing the sorting order helps if there is a large number of documents in the **Attachments** detail yet only the most recent documents are relevant. In this case, sort the records by creation date in descending order.\n5. **What to do with file?** \u2013 select one of the following options:\n1. \"**Use in process** \" if you need to use the file records in the process itself without saving the files to any Creatio object or if you need to to pass the files to a different business process as a parameter.\n2. \"**Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object** \" if you need to save the files to the **Attachments** detail of a particular object. You can also use the file collection in the process itself or pass these files to another business process as a parameter.\nIn this case, select \"Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object.\"\nnote\nIf you select \"Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object\" in the **Process file** element, Creatio will save the Ids of the copied file records. If necessary, you can connect the other process elements to these record Ids.\n6. **What object to save file to?** displays if you select \"Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object\" in the previous step. Specify the **Attachments** detail of the Creatio object that will contain the copied files. In this case you need to copy the files from a Creatio contact to a different contact's detail, therefore select \"Contact attachment.\"\nA new field connected to the selected object will appear. Specify the record that will store the saved files in this field. In this case, the **Attachments** detail is connected to the \"Contact\" object. Use [parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7054) or values to fill out this field. For example, click \"Lookup value,\" specify the relevant contact from the list, and click **Select**.\nFig. 3 Setting up the Process file element for file processing\n![Fig.\u00a03 Setting up the Process file element for file processing](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/BPM_Tools/process_file/process_file_word.png)\nThat way the element will copy the first 10 files selected based on the sorting order from the **Attachments** detail of the contact (e.g., James Smith) and save the files to the **Attachments** detail of another contact (e.g., Valerie E. Murphy) during a business process.\n### Example setup for process parameter files\u200b\nExample\nGet the file from a process parameter and add it to the current contact\u2019s **Attachments** detail.\nTo do this, set up the **Process file** element as displayed on Fig. 4.\n1. **What is the source of the file?** \u2013 select \"Process parameter\" to enable the element to read process parameters of the \"File\" type.\n2. **Files** \u2013 specify the process parameter that contains the relevant file. You can specify a single file or a collection. Click the ![btn_process_element_settings_lookup00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_parameters/btn_process_element_settings_lookup00002.png) button next to the field and select:\n* \"**Process parameter** \" to select the parameter whose value you want to pass.\n* \"**Formula** \" to set up file generation conditions based on the process parameters.\n3. **What object to save file to?** \u2013 specify the **Attachments** detail of a Creatio object to store the copied files. Since this example requires copying the file to the current contact\u2019s detail, select the \"Contact attachment\" value.\nDepending on the specified object, a new field may appear. Use this field to specify the record to store the saved files. For this example, the **Attachments** detail is connected to the \"Contact\" object. Use [parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7054) or values to fill out this field. For example, select \"Current user contact.\"\nFig. 4 Setting up the Process file element to process a file from the parameter\n![Fig.\u00a04 Setting up the Process file element to process a file from the parameter](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/BPM_Tools/process_file/process_file_from_parameter.png)\n## Generate reports in a business process\u200b\nThis functionality is available for Creatio version 7.17.2 and up.\nExample\nGenerate an order report and save it to the **Attachments** detail of a partnership.\nnote\nThe **Partnerships** section is available in Sales Creatio Enterprise and CRM Creatio.\nSet up the **Process file** element the following way (Fig. 5).\n1. **What is the source of the file?** \u2013 select \"Generated report\" to let the element generate a report during the process itself.\n2. **What report to generate?** \u2013 select an available report from the dropdown. In this case, select \"Order.\"\n**Word** always generates individual reports for each record. Learn more about generating reports in the [Print-ready reports](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/no_code_customization/print_ready_reports) section.\n3. **Section** \u2013 displays the section used as a report source. This is a non-editable field.\n4. **How to filter records?** \u2013 set the necessary filters. In this case, filter orders issued in specific currencies: Euro or US Dollar. Read more about working with filters in the [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017) article.\n5. **File name** \u2013 set a custom report file name pattern. Use [parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7054) or values to fill out this field. For example, click \"Column from this selection\" \u2192 \"Number\" to set the file name pattern based on the order number.\n6. **File name** \u2013 set a custom report file name pattern. The file name will consist of the report\u2019s name and the value specified in this parameter. For example, select **Column from this selection** \u2192 **Number** to make the name of the generated file look like this: \"Order. ORD-30.\"\n7. **What to do with file?** \u2013 select one of the following options:\n1. \"**Use in process** \" if you need to use the file records in the process itself without saving the files to any Creatio object or if you need to to pass the files to a different business process as a parameter.\n2. \"**Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object** \" if you need to save the files to the **Attachments** detail of a particular object. You can also use the file collection in the process itself or pass these files to another business process as a parameter.\nIn this case, select \"Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object.\"\nnote\nIf you select \"Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object\" in the **Process file** element, Creatio will save the Ids of the copied file records. If necessary, you can connect the other process elements to these record Ids.\n3. **What object to save file to?** displays if you select \"Save to \"Attachments and notes\" of the object\" in the previous step. Specify the **Attachments** detail of the Creatio object that will contain the copied files. In this case you need to save the generated report to the partnership record, therefore select \"Partnership attachment.\"\nA new field connected to the selected object will appear. Specify the record that will store the saved files in this field. In this case, the **Attachments** detail is connected to the \"Partnership\" object. Use [parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7054) or values to fill out this field. For example, click \"Lookup value,\" specify the relevant partnership from the list, and click **Select**.\nFig. 5 Setting up the Process file element for report generation\n![Fig.\u00a05 Setting up the Process file element for report generation](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/BPM_Tools/process_file/process_file_report.png)\nThat way the element will generate a set of reports for all the filtered records of the **Orders** section during a business process. Creatio will save the reports to the **Attachments** detail of the partnership (for instance, ClearSoft Systems).\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Send email process element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7127)\n[Process data](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7151)",
