  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nCreatio IDE lets you work with the SVN version control system.\nImportant\nUse the SVN version control system only to transfer changes between [development environments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15201). Do not use SVN on a [pre-production](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15201&anchor=title-2124-2) or [production](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15201&anchor=title-2124-3) environment. This can render Creatio inoperable or decrease its performance. Learn more in a separate article: [Version control in Subversion](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15142).\nThe [out-of-the-box Creatio IDE tools](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15203) let you execute the following actions:\n* install package from the SVN repository\n* update package from the SVN repository\n* commit package to the SVN repository\nYou cannot work with the SVN version control system using the out-of-the-box Creatio IDE tools when the [file system development mode](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15111) is turned on. By default, the file system development mode is turned off.\nSVN integration is enabled in Creatio by default. To set up SVN integration, modify the value of the `defPackagesWorkingCopyPath` setting\u2019s `connectionString` attribute in the `ConnectionStrings.config` configuration file. This setting contains the path to the directory that stores working copies.\nConnectionStrings.config\n<add name=\"defPackagesWorkingCopyPath\" connectionString=\"TEMP\\APPLICATION\\WORKSPACE\\TerrasoftPackages\" >  \nCreatio makes and uses a working copy of each user-made package with versioning enabled in SVN integration mode. The working copy contains user-made packages organized as a set of directories and files. The Creatio SVN client synchronizes this data with an SVN repository. We recommend specifying the path to a permanent directory in the `defPackagesWorkingCopyPath` system setting. The OS might clear the temporary directory specified by default. Do not specify `...\\Terrasoft.WebApp\\Terrasoft.Configuration\\Pkg` as the repository of working package copies in Creatio .NET Framework.\n## Install a package from the SVN repository\u200b\n**Package installation** involves adding the package and its dependencies from the SVN repository.\nInstall the package in the following **cases** :\n* Multiple developers work on the package functionality.\n* You need to transfer the changes between [environments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15201).\nIf you use **Creatio in the cloud** , we recommend contacting Creatio support to install the package.\nTo **install a package from the SVN repository** in Creatio on-site:\n1. Back up the database.\nThis is required because it is not possible to roll back to the previous version using the SVN version control system.\n2. [Open the **Configuration** section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15101&anchor=title-2093-2).\n3. Select **Install package from repository** in the **SVN repositories** group of the action menu.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/InstallPackageFromStorage\\(7.17\\)/scr_menu1.png)\n4. Select the SVN repository as well as name and version of the package to install \u2192 **Install**.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/InstallPackageFromStorage/7.17/scr_select_dialog.png)\nCreatio applies bound data and sets dependencies automatically as part of the package installation.\nIn some cases, the changes are not applied automatically. If this happens, apply the changes manually.\nTo **apply the changes manually** to an installed package:\n1. [Open the **Configuration** section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15101&anchor=title-2093-2).\n2. Generate source codes for configuration elements that require it.\n3. Compile the configuration.\n4. Update the database structure.\n5. Install SQL scripts if needed.\n6. Install bound data.\nnote\nYou can check whether to update the database structure, SQL scripts, and bound data in the **Needs to be installed in database** and **Needs to be updated in database** properties. A dialog will appear if an error occurs.\n5. Click **Compile all**. This is required to [generate static content](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15126&anchor=title-1197-8).\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/InstallPackageFromStorage\\(7.17\\)/7.17/scr_compile_all.png)\nWhen you install a user-made package, Creatio checks its dependencies and additionally sets or updates the dependency packages of the current package. For example, when you install the **sdkUserMadePackage** package from the SVN repository, the **sdkDependentPackage** dependent package is installed as well. This also changes the Creatio package hierarchy. If the **sdkUserMadePackage** package was installed previously, it is changed.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/InstallPackageFromStorage/7.17/scr_dependent.png)\nWhen you instal a user-made package from the SVN repository, Creatio changes the **package hierarchy** as follows:\n1. The dependencies of the installed package are defined. View the dependencies in the `DependsOn` property of the package properties.\nPackage properties\n{  \n\"Descriptor\": {  \n\"UId\": \"8bc92579-92ee-4ff2-8d44-1ca61542aa1b\",  \n\"PackageVersion\": \"7.18.0\",  \n\"Name\": \"sdkUserMadePackage\",  \n\"ModifiedOnUtc\": \"\\/Date(1522671879000)\\/\",  \n\"Maintainer\": \"Customer\",  \n\"Description\": \"Package created by user\",  \n\"DependsOn\": [{  \n\"UId\": \"51b3ed42-678c-4da3-bd16-8596b95c0546\",  \n\"PackageVersion\": \"7.18.0\",  \n\"Name\": \"sdkDependentPackage\"  \n},  \n{  \n\"UId\": \"e14dcfb1-e53c-4439-a876-af7f97083ed9\",  \n\"PackageVersion\": \"7.18.0\",  \n\"Name\": \"SalesEnterprise\"  \n}  \n]  \n}  \n}  \n2. The installation of the dependent packages into the configuration is verified. If the packages are installed, Creatio updates them, otherwise, it installs them.\nImportant\nIf the dependencies are not found in SVN repositories (e. g., the SVN repository is not registered in the repository list or is inactive), a message about package installation error appears. The package dependency hierarchy is updated when a package is installed. As such, add the SVN repositories that contain dependent packages to the configuration and activate these repositories.\n3. When a package is installed, Creatio installs or updates only the dependencies installed in the SVN version control system. Packages installed from *.zip archives and pre-installed packages are not updated.\nInstall the packages on which the user-made package or its dependencies depend before you install the user-made package. Installation fails if the workspace lacks any pre-installed dependency package installed from a *.zip archive.\n## Update a package from the SVN repository\u200b\n**Package update** involves uploading the changes in both the package and package [dependencies](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15121&anchor=title-2105-3) from the SVN repository into the Creatio. The dependencies of the updated package are defined as part of the update. View the dependencies in the `DependsOn` property of the package properties.\nUpdate the package in the following **cases** :\n* Multiple developers work on the package functionality.\n* You need to transfer the changes between [environments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15201).\n* You are going to commit the changes.\nTo **update a package from the SVN repository** :\n1. [Open the **Configuration** section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15101&anchor=title-2093-2).\n2. Select **Update from repository** in the package menu.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/UpdatePackageFromStorage\\(7.17\\)/pkg_updatet_mnu.png)\nThis starts the update of the selected package and dependent packages from the active SVN repositories.\nImportant\nIf the package dependencies are located in inactive SVN repositories, a message about package update error appears. The package dependency hierarchy is updated when a package is updated. As such, activate the SVN repositories that can contain dependent packages.\n3. Click **Compile all**. This is required to [generate static content](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15126&anchor=title-1197-8).\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/InstallPackageFromStorage\\(7.17\\)/7.17/scr_compile_all.png)\n## Commit a package to the SVN repository\u200b\n**Package committing** involves saving the package changes to the SVN repository. Only the package for which you execute the commit action is committed to the SVN repository. Changes to other configuration packages are not committed.\nCommit the package in the following **cases** :\n* You [create](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15122) a user-made package.\n* You add new configuration elements to the package.\n* You modify the existing package configuration elements.\n* You delete the package configuration elements.\n* You [modify the package properties](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15122).\nThe **repository** appears next to the package name. Hold the pointer over the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CommitPackageToStorage/scr_repository.png) icon to view the **name of the connected repository**.\nThe following data is displayed for **uncommitted user-made packages** :\n* Package name.\n* Name of the SVN repository where to commit the package. The revision number of the package in the SVN repository is not specified and added after the package is committed.\nUncommitted user-made packages are locked by default.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CommitPackageToStorage/scr_repository_name.png)\nThe following data is displayed for **committed user-made packages** :\n* Package name.\n* SVN repository name.\n* Last revision number of the package in the SVN repository\nThe display style of a committed user-made package that remains unchanged is the same as a base package.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CommitPackageToStorage/scr_repository_revision.png)\nIf you change a user-made package, for example, add schemas or change properties, Creatio displays ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CommitPackageToStorage/scr_repository_icon.png) next to the package name.\nImportant\nIf you remove a configuration element from a package, the package looks like it was not changed.\nTo **commit a package to the SVN repository** :\n1. [Open the **Configuration** section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15101&anchor=title-2093-2).\n2. Select **Commit to repository** in the package menu.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CommitPackageToStorage\\(7.17\\)/pkg_commit_mnu.png)\nThis opens the change committing dialog.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CommitPackageToStorage\\(7.17\\)/pre_commit_info.png)\n3. Add a comment to the package commit in the required **Description** field. We recommend describing the changes in the package compared to the last commit. The changes in the commit package are displayed in the bottom.\nAfter you click the **Commit changes** button, the package is commited and changes become available to other Creatio users.\nImportant\nThe package is committed to the SVN repository specified in the package properties. You can only commit a package to an active SVN repository.\nAfter the package is committed to the SVN repository, the package as well as its configuration elements are unlocked. The configuration elements also become editable for other Creatio users.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Version control in Subversion](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15142)\n[Environment overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15201)\n[Delivery in Creatio IDE](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15203)",
