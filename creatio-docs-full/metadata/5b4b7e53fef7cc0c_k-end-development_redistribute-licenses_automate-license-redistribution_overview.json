Learn more about Creatio license types: [Creatio licenses overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=1264) (user documentation).\nCreatio supports manual and role-based license redistribution and provides tools to automate role-based redistribution.

Before triggering role-based license redistribution, ensure that the preliminary setup is completed. Instructions: [Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=1472&anchor=preliminary-setup) (user documentation).\n## Automate role-based license redistribution using User task process element\u200b\nCreatio provides the following **User task** process element for role-based license redistribution:\n* \"Redistribute licenses\" user task that redistributes licenses **for all active users or a specific user role**. The user task is implemented in the \"Redistribute licenses\" (`RedistributeLicensesUserTask` code) schema of the \"User task\" type.\n* \"Redistribute licenses for specific user\" user task that redistributes licenses **for a single user**. The user task is implemented in the \"Redistribute licenses for specific user\" (`RedistributeLicensesForSpecificUserUserTask` code) schema of the \"User task\" type.\nTo automate role-based license redistribution using **User task** element added to a business process:\n1. **Add the User task element** to the business process schema. We recommend adding the element to the user creation process, immediately after the users are added or list of user roles is changed.\n2. **Select the way to redistribute licenses based on user roles**.\nRedistribute licenses for all active users or a specific user role\nChoose this way when you need to:\n* redistribute licenses for multiple newly created or imported users\n* recalculate licenses when roles are reorganized or updated\nTo redistribute licenses for all active users or a specific user role:\n1. Select \"Redistribute licenses\" in the **Which user task to perform?** parameter on the setup area.\n2. Fill out the **Redistribute licenses for specific role** parameter to redistribute licenses for a specific user role. If the parameter is empty, licenses are redistributed for all active users.\n3. Fill out the **Redistribute manually assigned licenses** parameter to redistribute manually assigned licenses. If the parameter is set to \"true,\" manually assigned licenses are revoked before assigning new licenses according to user roles.\n4. Fill out the **Role identifier** parameter to redistribute licenses for a specific user role.\nRedistribute licenses for a single user\nChoose this way when you need to:\n* assign licenses when a new user is created\n* update licenses when a user is added to or removed from a role\n* redistribute licenses when a user is reactivated\n* limit the redistribution to a single user without affecting others\n* ensure that the user receives correct licenses based on current roles\nTo redistribute licenses for a single user:\n1. Select \"Redistribute licenses for specific user\" in the **Which user task to perform?** parameter on the setup area to redistribute licenses for a single user.\n2. Fill out the **User identifier** parameter to redistribute licenses for a single user.\nNow you can redistribute licenses based on user roles. Before triggering role-based license redistribution, ensure that the preliminary setup is completed. Instructions: [Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=1472&anchor=preliminary-setup) (user documentation).\n## Automate role-based license redistribution using LicenseRedistributionService class\u200b\nUse the `LicenseRedistributionService` class to automate role-based license redistribution programmatically in advanced automation or integration scenarios. The class encapsulates the core logic of role-based license redistribution and provides the following methods:\n* `RedistributeLicences(bool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences)` that redistributes licenses **for all active users**.\n* `RedistributeLicencesForRole(bool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences, Guid roleId)` that redistributes licenses **for users of a specific role**.\n* `RedistributeLicencesForUser(Guid userId, bool redistributeManuallyAssignedLicences, bool hasManuallyAssignedLicense)` that redistributes licenses **for a single user**.\nLearn more about methods of the `LicenseRedistributionService` class: [LicenseRedistributionService class](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=15389).\nView the examples that automate role-based license redistribution using the `LicenseRedistributionService` class in different scenarios below.\n* Create a user and redistribute their licenses\n* Redistribute licenses for multiple users\n* Redistribute licenses for a user role with error handling\n* Redistribute licenses based on business rule condition\n/* Create contact. */  \nvar contact = CreateContact(employeeData);  \n/* Create a user for the contact. */  \nvar userId = CreateUser(contact.Id);  \n/* Add the user to required user roles. */  \nAddUserToRoles(userId, employeeRoles);  \n/* Redistribute licenses for the user based on their granted roles. */  \nvar service = ClassFactory.Get<ILicenseRedistributionService>();  \nservice.RedistributeLicencesForUser(userId);  \n/* Create and add multiple users. */  \nforeach (var employeeData in data) {  \nvar userId = CreateUser(employeeData);  \nuserIds.Add(userId);  \n}  \n/* Recalculate and redistribute licenses for all active users.

Before triggering role-based license redistribution, ensure that the preliminary setup is completed. Instructions: [Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=1472&anchor=preliminary-setup) (user documentation).\n## Recommendations for automating role-based license redistribution\u200b\nThese recommendations apply to all ways of role-based license redistribution.\n### Recommendations for minimizing the impact of role-based license redistribution\u200b\n* Run large-scale redistributions during non-business hours.\n* For large user groups, split the task into batches of 500\u20131000 users to shorten lock times and reduce resource consumption.\n* When possible, perform redistribution at the role level rather than for all users to reduce processing time and minimize the duration of transactional locks.\n* Batch processing is especially effective when using the `LicenseRedistributionService` class.\n### Recommendations for redistributing licenses at scale\u200b\nWhen redistributing licenses for large user groups (more than 1 000 users), Creatio applies the following behavior:\n* Operation duration depends on database size, user count, and server workload.\n* The environment might temporarily consume additional resources while recalculating licenses.\n* Creatio applies short-term database-level transactional locks to license-related tables, primarily allocation tables. This is standard behavior for relational databases.\n* End users remain able to work with Creatio. They can continue navigating the UI, viewing data, and performing operations.\n* Manual license updates initiated during redistribution might be processed more slowly because they wait until the current transaction to the license data is completed.\n* Any waiting is typically brief and depends on the volume of processed data.\nIn most cases, users do not notice the redistribution unless they attempt to update licenses at the same time manually.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Creatio licenses overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=1264) (user documentation)\n[Manage user licenses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=1472) (user documentation)\n[LicenseRedistributionService class](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=15389)\n[Workflow of role-based license redistribution](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.2&id=15390)",
