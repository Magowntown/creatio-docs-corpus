  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Marketing\nOn this page\nThis guide outlines the steps for creating and sending bulk emails in Creatio Email Marketing app.\nnote\nThe Creatio on-site users need to set up integration with a marketing email provider before they start using the email functionality in Creatio. Learn more: [Bulk emails](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1777).\nThe general procedure to create a bulk email is as follows:\n1. Create a new bulk email record. Read more >>>\n2. Design the template. Read more >>>\n3. Fill out the headers. Read more >>>\n4. Add the email audience. Read more >>>\n## Create a new bulk email record\u200b\nAll emails in the Email Marketing app are stored and managed in the **Bulk emails** section. To create a bulk email:\n1. **Access the Bulk Emails section**. Open the **Bulk Emails** section, for example within **Email Marketing** workplace.\nFig. 1 The Bulk emails section\n![Fig.\u00a01 The Bulk emails section](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/new_bulk_email/scr_bulk_email_section_overview.png)\n2. **Create a new record**. Click the **Create email** button. This opens a mini page.\n3. **Fill out the parameters** on the mini page of the new record (Fig. 2):\nFig. 2 Add a bulk email\n![Fig.\u00a02 Add a bulk email](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/new_bulk_email/scr_add_email_mini_page.png)\nParameter| Value  \n---|---  \nName| Specify the name of the new bulk email. The name will be displayed in the **Bulk emails** section list only, the recipients will not see it.  \nGoal| Enter a brief description of the email's goal. This can be promoting products or services, announcing sales or events, building brand awareness.  \nEmail type| Specify the type of your email, for example, \"Focus email\" or \"Newsletter.\"  \nCategory (Creatio 8.2.0)| The following bulk email categories are used in Creatio:\n* A **bulk email** is sent to a large number of recipients manually.\n* A **trigger email** is sent as a result of a particular event or action performed by a website visitor. In Creatio, trigger emails can only be sent as part of a campaign.\nSending method (Creatio 8.2.1 and later)| The following sending methods are available in Creatio:\n* **Manual at optimal time**. Sends emails to a large number of recipients whenever you want.\n* **Using a campaign flow**. Sends an email as part of a specific campaign event. Learn more: [Add a campaign](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1074).\n4. **Check the box** to confirm that you have read and agree to [Marketing email functionality usage policy](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2546).\n5. **Save the record** to create the bulk email draft.\n## Design the bulk email's template\u200b\nA template is the content your target audience will receive via email.\nnote\nYou can only edit the template before you start sending the email.\nCreate email templates in the **Email Designer** , a visual block-based drag and drop editor that lets you create and set up email templates that look great on desktop and mobile devices.\nYou can use the Email Designer to design templates with complex layouts, such as marketing emails, newsletters, greeting cards, etc. Working in the Email Designer does not require an in-depth understanding of HTML. Creatio generates the code automatically based on the layout that you design in the visual editor.\nAn email template consists of a series of content blocks that have text, images, buttons, separators, and their different combinations. We recommend taking a look at the pre-configured blocks before you start working on a template. If these blocks do not meet your needs, you can edit them or create custom blocks. You can personalize the email content to foster a trust-based relationship with your customers and increase brand loyalty.\nTo create an email template:\n1. **Open the bulk email** you created.\n2. Click **Design content**.\nFig. 4 Open Email Designer\n![Fig.\u00a04 Open Email Designer](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/new_bulk_email/scr_design_email_content.png)\n3. **Outline the email structure** using the pre-configured blocks.\nFig. 5 The email structure\n![Fig.\u00a05 The email structure](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/new_bulk_email/scr_email_template_structure.png)\n4. **Add custom content**. Here are few tips for content design:\nFig. 6 The email content\n![Fig.\u00a06 The email content](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/app_overview/scr_email_designer.png)\n* The general design **settings** you apply to your email template will automatically be inherited by the individual structure and content blocks. This means that the font family, colors, and other design elements you choose will be used consistently throughout your email, unless you specifically override them in a particular block. This streamlined approach helps you create a cohesive and visually appealing design quickly.\n* The **row** structure offers a variety of options for structuring your email design. Rows are the building blocks that determine the horizontal layout of your email content. Each row can contain one to six columns for emails, allowing you to arrange different content elements side by side. You have complete flexibility to add as many rows and columns as needed to create the desired structure for your email, regardless of the template you initially selected.\n* The **content** settings feature a variety of tiles representing the different types of content you can include in your email design. When added to the canvas the tile will automatically adjust to fit the width of the column. Each content block offers its own settings, allowing for precise control over elements like padding. As you select a content block, the setup area on the right will switch to display the tools to customize that specific element.\n5. **Apply the styles** and formatting.\n6. **Save changes** to preserve your template design.\n## Fill out the bulk email's headers\u200b\nBulk email headers provide essential information that helps you categorize, track, and analyze your email marketing efforts. To fill out the headers:\n1. **Open the bulk email** you created.\n2. **Fill out the header parameters** (Fig. 2):\nFig. 3 Bulk email headers\n![Fig.\u00a03 Bulk email headers](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/new_bulk_email/scr_new_email.png)\nParameter| Value  \n---|---  \nSender's name| This name will be displayed to the recipient.If the sender's email is in the address book of the recipient, then upon receiving an email, the recipient will see the name specified in the address book.  \nSender's email| The specified email address will be displayed to the recipient.When you enter an email address, it is automatically checked for validity.Sending emails from unverified domains is limited to 500 daily. Verify your domain to increase the sending limit. Learn more: [Email domain verification](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/email-domain-verification).  \nSubject| Enter the subject of the email. You can incorporate emojis into the subject line. Learn more: [Guidelines for increasing deliverability](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2389&anchor=title-3591-2).  \n3. **Save changes** to update the header information.\n## Add bulk email audience\u200b\nUse the **Audience** tab to set up the list of recipients for a bulk email. You can add multiple recipients to the email.\nTo add email audience:\n1. **Open the bulk email** you created.\n2. **Go to the Audience tab** of the email page.\n3. **Click Add contacts**. This opens a window.\n4. **Select records** to add to the email audience manually or from a folder.\n* To add records **manually** , select them in the list.\n* To add records **from a folder** , in the folder tree, select the needed folder. Learn more about how to work with folders: [Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1018).\n5. Click **Select**.\nFig. 7 The audience of an email\n![Fig.\u00a07 The audience of an email](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Marketing_Tools/email_marketing_app/new_bulk_email/scr_bulk_email_audience.png)\nWhen adding an email audience, Creatio does not verify the audience duplicates. We recommend checking the audience manually before sending emails. Learn more: [Prevent sending duplicate emails to the same email address](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1890).\n**As a result** , your bulk email draft will be saved and ready to start sending.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Start an email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2547)\n[Use dynamic content in marketing emails](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2596)\n[Marketing email functionality usage policy](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2546)",
