  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.2\nOn this page\nOne of the primary components of a visit rule is the sale rep \"to-do\" list \u2013 the activities that sales reps are required to complete during a visit. This functionality lets field staff perform the following basic actions on their mobile devices:\nCheck-in| Creatio receives GPS coordinates of the sales rep's location and the visit status is changed to \"In progress.\"  \n---|---  \nPresentation| Opens a PowerPoint or PDF presentation on the sales rep's mobile device (the presentation must be added to the **Attachments and notes** detail of the visit record in the **Activities** section). If several presentations have been added to the detail, the sales rep will have to select the needed one.  \nCheck-out| Creatio receives the GPS coordinates of the sales rep's location and the visit status is changed to \"Completed.\"  \nYou can supplement the list of sales rep visit actions by adding new records to the **Visit actions type** lookup. Employees mark visit actions as \"complete\" by toggling a switch in the mobile device. The connection between visit actions and system sections (e.g., creating a new contract based on a visit action) is carried out only through development.\n## Set up a med rep visit rule\u200b\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_set_rules_and_actions/btn_system_designer.png) to open the System Designer.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 click **Lookups**.\n3. Click the **Field sales rules** lookup.\n4. On the lookup content page, click the **New rule** button.\n5. Populate the required fields:\n1. Populate the **Name** field, for example, \"2nd quarter of 2020 (Downtown)\" or \"1st quarter (Uptown).\"\n2. In the **Start** and **Due** fields, specify the time limit of rule validity.\n3. Specify visit duration (including travel time) in the corresponding field.\n4. In the **Number of visits** field, enter the approximate number of visits of this type that a field staff member can perform during one day.\n6. Click **Save**.\n7. Similarly, specify the other rules. For example, the rules may vary by the due date or depending on the location a sales rep is operating in.\nAs a result, these rules will be taken into account when building a schedule for the sales reps.\nIn the **Visit scheduling** view of the **Activities** section, drag a sales outlet from the list to the left and drop it into the calendar. The duration of the visit will be set automatically, according to the **Visit duration** value from the corresponding visit rule.\nIf several rules can be applied to a sales outlet, Creatio will let you choose which rule to use.\n## Manage med rep visit actions\u200b\nUse the **Field visit rules** lookup to set up the list of activities that must be completed during a visit.\nTo add an action:\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer00001.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_set_rules_and_actions/btn_system_designer00001.png) to open the System Designer.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 click **Lookups**.\n3. Click the **Field sales rules** lookup.\n4. Select a rule to form an action and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_edit.png) (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Open a rule for editing\n![Fig.\u00a01 Open a rule for editing](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/field_module/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_field_force/scr_field_force_edit_rule.png)\n5. On the rule page, expand the **Actions during visit** detail and click the **Add** button.\n6. Populate the columns of the new record:\n1. Select the visit action type \"Check-in,\" \"Check-out,\" \"Presentation,\" etc.\n2. Use the **Actions priority order** column, to set up sequence of sales rep activities. For example, if the action is the first in the \"to-do\" list, enter \"1.\"\n3. Select the **Required** checkbox for the actions that should not be skipped during a visit.\nThe sales rep will not be able to complete the visit until all the required actions are performed.\n7. Click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_apply.png) to save the visit action.\n8. Similarly, add the rest of the visit actions.\nAs a result, when you drag a sales outlet and drop it into the calendar in the **Visit scheduling** view of the **Activities** section, the **Visit actions** detail of the visit will be populated automatically. The list of actions on the detail will correspond to the list of actions set up in the lookup.\n## Add a presentation to a visit\u200b\nThe \"Presentation\" visit action requires additional setup so that the field staff members have full access to the presentation materials.\nIn the system, create a knowledge base article and add a PowerPoint presentation (*.pptx) or PDF file on its **Attachments** detail. Then, link the article to the \"Presentation\" visit action. As a result, your sales reps will be able to show the attached presentation from their mobile device during visits.\nnote\nYou can add not just PowerPoint presentations but also any other documents to the knowledge base article. In this case, when performing the \"Presentation\" action, this document will be opened using the default applications for that file type on the mobile device.\nTo add a presentation:\n1. Click ![btn_system_designer00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_set_rules_and_actions/btn_system_designer00002.png) to open the System Designer.\n2. Go to the **System setup** block \u2192 click **Lookups**.\n3. Click the **Field sales rules** lookup.\n4. Open the needed rule and go to the **Actions during visit** detail.\n5. Select the \"Presentation\" record and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_edit.png).\n6. On the displayed page, expand the **Presentation** detail and click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png).\n7. In the displayed string, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_lookup.png) in the field.\n8. In the displayed lookup, select a knowledge base article with an attached presentation.\n9. If necessary, add other knowledge base articles with attachments.\nAs a result, when a field staff member performs the **Presentation** visit action, the PowerPoint presentation (or any other document) attached to the knowledge base article will open on their mobile device. All presentations and materials will be available on the **Attachments and notes** detail of the visit.\nAlso, all visits planned in the calendar (the **Visit scheduling** view of the **Activities** section), will have links to the knowledge base articles specified on the **Attachments and notes** detail.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Install Field Management for Creatio](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1374)\n[Schedule sales rep visits](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2333)\n[Set up visit actions for sales reps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2332)\n[Check-in verification for sales reps](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2335)",
