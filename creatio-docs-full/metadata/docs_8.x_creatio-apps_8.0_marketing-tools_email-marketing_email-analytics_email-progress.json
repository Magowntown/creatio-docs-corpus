Use this data to adjust the email sending process and improve the delivery rate. The following email data is available:\n* Email delivery chart that displays the current status of individual emails.\n* Email sending progress analytics that displays recipient quantity and percentage metrics by status.\n* The email start and finish date and time.\n* Sending log that displays successful events and sending errors.\nSummary data for emails started in the last 72 hours is available in the sending progress dashboard.\nFig. 1 Email sending progress\n![Fig.\u00a01 Email sending progress](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Marketing_Tools/email_progress/email_progress_page.png)\n## Email delivery progress chart\u200b\nThe **chart** (Fig. 2) on the email page visualizes real-time information about the email sending and delivery progress. Hover over the chart to view the more information by email status.\nFig. 2 Email progress chart\n![Fig.\u00a02 Email progress chart](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Marketing_Tools/email_progress/email_progress_bar.png)\n* **Preparing to send** \u2013 the number of emails Creatio has not yet sent. For instance, Creatio sets the status to \"Preparing to send\" when going through the [throttling](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2337) segmentation. This status corresponds to the \"Planned\" response.\n* **Queued** \u2013 the number of segmented and ready-to-send emails for which Creatio has not yet received the mail provider's response. This status corresponds to the \"Queued\" response.\n* **Delivered** \u2013 the number of emails delivered to recipients. This is the number of recipients with the \"Accepted by the server\" mail service provider response.\n* **Bounce** \u2013 the number of emails with \"Hard Bounce\" and \"Soft Bounce\" responses.\n* **Delivery error** \u2013 the number of emails with \"Sending error (to provider)\" and \"Rejected\" responses.\n* **Stopped** \u2013 the number of unprocessed emails. This is the number of recipients with \"Stopped (manually)\" and \"Stopped (time to send expired)\" responses.\n* **Canceled** \u2013 the number of unsent emails. This is the sum of recipients with the \"Canceled (Duplicate email),\" \"Canceled (Unsubscribed from all emails),\" \"Canceled (Unreachable email), \"Canceled (Incorrect email),\" and \"Canceled (email not provided)\" responses.\nRead more: [Personal responses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1985).\n## Email sending progress analytics\u200b\nCreatio displays email progress analytics in \"Metric\" type dashboards on the **Sending progress** tab (Fig. 1):\n* **Recipients** \u2013 the number of email recipients.\n* **Preparing to send** \u2013 the number and percentage of emails Creatio is yet to send. This metric corresponds to the \"Planned\" response in the **Audience** tab and should display 0 for completed emails.\n* **Queued** \u2013 the number of segmented emails the cloud service provider is ready to send or has already sent but for which it has not yet received the mail provider's response. This metric corresponds to the \"Sent to the provider\" response in the **Audience** tab and should display 0 for completed emails.\n* **Sent** \u2013 how many recipients returned the provider's first response. This metric corresponds to the \"Delivered,\" \"Hard Bounce,\" \"Soft Bounce,\" and other similar responses in the **Audience** tab.\n* **Stopped** \u2013 the number of recipients Creatio did not process, either due to [manual](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1518) stop of the email or due to the email reaching the expiration date.\n* **Canceled** \u2013 the number of unsent emails. This metric corresponds to the \"Canceled (Duplicate email),\" \"Canceled (Unsubscribed from all emails),\" \"Canceled (Unreachable email), \"Canceled (Incorrect email),\" and \"Canceled (email not provided)\" responses in the **Audience** tab.\nRead more: [Personal responses](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1985).\n## Email start/finish date\u200b\nYou can view the following information in the **Sending duration** field group:\n* **Started on** \u2013 the email start date.\n* **Finished on** \u2013 the email completion date.\n* **Duration** \u2013 how much time it took to send the email to all recipients.\n## Sending log\u200b\nMonitor the email sending progress in the **Sending log** detail on the **Sending progress** tab.\nAlternatively, view data about all bulk emails in the mailing log. Open the mailing log from the **System designer** or by clicking **Email** \u2192 **Actions** \u2192 **Mailing log**.\nShould any errors occur during the sending process, the log will help you to find out the reasons and fix the original issue.\nThe log displays data as a record list. The **Type** column specifies the log record type: \"Info\" for successful events or \"Error\" for unsuccessful events.\n### Successful events in the sending log\u200b\nThe table below lists events that indicate successful email sending progress.\nEvent| Description| Comment  \n---|---|---  \nStart sending email| The email is scheduled on {MM/DD/YYY HH:MM:SS time zone}.| Creatio will record this event for bulk emails only if you select \"at the specified time\" in the **Send time** field and click Schedule sending.  \nSending email was started.| Creatio records this event after the email starts regardless of the start option.  \nCheck integration with cloud email service| Connection with cloud email service is active.| Creatio records this event before the email starts.
