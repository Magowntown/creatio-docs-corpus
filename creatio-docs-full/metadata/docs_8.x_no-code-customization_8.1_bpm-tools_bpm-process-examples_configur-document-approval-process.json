Each document is sent for approval manually by launching the process in the section. All employees in the **Financial department** role can approve documents. Additionally, all employees eligible for approving documents receive an email notification once the approval is created. The employee awaiting the approval receives an email once the document is approved. If approved, the document status is changed to \"Active.\" If it was not approved, the document status is changed to \"Draft,\" and Creatio automatically creates an activity for the responsible employee to revise the document.\nThe configuration procedure includes the following general steps:\n1. Set up the approval case as shown on Fig. 1.\n2. Set up running the approval business process for records that require approval in the corresponding section.\nImportant\nBefore creating and configuring an approval business process, make sure that the **Enable approval in section** checkbox is selected for that section in the section wizard.

Copy the previously created **Read data** element of the **System actions** group \u2013 \"Read document data\" \u2013 and place it after the **Change document status to Draft** element on the diagram. This element determines the responsible individual for re-working the document.\n10. Add the **Perform task** element from the **User actions** group to the process diagram (\"Revise the document\"). This element will create a task (activity) for the individual to edit the document if it was not approved.\n11. Set up the element properties (Fig. 6):\n1. Enter the name of the task in the **What should be done?** field.\n2. Select the start time of the task in the **Start in** field, and the approximate duration of the task in the **Planned duration** field. The value of the **Start in** field determines a time period at the end of which the task will be scheduled. In the **Planned duration** field, specify the approximate duration of the task.\n3. Select the **Show in calendar** checkbox to display the task in the responsible individual\u2019s calendar.\n4.

Save the business process. Once saved, configure the start of a business process.\n## Set up business process launch\u200b\nThe process is launched by clicking the **Run process** button on the record page or in the section list. The button is not displayed by default and requires additional setup (Fig. 7).\nTo configure the button, connect the document approval process to records for which it will be launched. To do this:\n1. Click the **View** button in the **Contacts** section and select the **Open section wizard** command.\n2. Open the **Business process** tab. Click the ![btn_com_add_tab00035.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_com_add_tab00035.png) button on the **Run business process from section** detail. The window of the business process launch settings will be opened.\n3. Select the \"Document approval\" process in the **Which process to run?** field.\n4. To start the process for separate section records, select the \"For selected record\" radio button.\nThe **Process parameter where the record is passed** field is populated automatically with the \"Document\" parameter of the \"Document approval\" process.\n5. Save the changes in the window and the section wizard.\nFig. 7 Add a business process to a section\n![Fig.\u00a07 Add a business process to a section](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_process_creation_designer_run_process_for_selected_record_setup.png)\nAs a result, you will be able to launch the approval process for any record of the **Documents** section (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 Launch the process from the Documents section list\n![Fig.\u00a08 Launch the process from the Documents section list](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_process_creation_designer_document_approvement_run_process_from_the_list.png)\n## Set up custom email templates for approval notifications\u200b\nUse the [**Approval**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7134) process element to set up custom logic for approving various Creatio records (documents, invoices, orders, etc.) by Creatio users. Both the approver and the user who submits the record for approval will receive email notifications about the approval procedure.\nYou can set up custom email templates for these notifications. Note that approval notification emails do not require additional **Send email** elements, and are configured in the **Approval** process element.\nExample\nDuring a document approval process (Fig. 9), the approver must receive an email notification, containing document type, number and the name of the user who submitted the document for approval. The user who submitted the document for approval, must receive a notification about the approval result.\nThe instructions below assume that you have enabled approvals in the **Documents** section, added the **Approval** element on the process diagram (Fig. 9) and set up its properties. Read more about enabling approvals in the [**Approval** process element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7134) article.\nFig. 9 A business process for approving documents\n![Fig. 9\u00a0A business process for approving documents](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_process_creation_designer_document_approvement00036.png)\nTo set up templates:\n1. Populate the fields of the **Approval** element setup area. If the **Approval section** field is populated, available email templates for approval notification will be filtered according to the selected section.\n2. Select the **Notify that approval is required** checkbox. As a result, whenever a record is submitted for approval, a notification will be sent to the \"approver\" user. If \"Role\" is selected in the **Approver** field, the notification will be sent to all users with the corresponding role.\n3. In the **Email template** field, click ![btn_com_add_tab00038.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_com_add_tab00038.png) (Fig. 10). A new email template window will open on a new tab.\nFig. 10 Opening the email template of an approval notification\n![Fig.\u00a010 Opening the email template of an approval notification](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_bpmn_approval_email_add_template.png)\n4. In the new template window, populate the **Template name** field. Note that if you populated the **Approval section** field earlier, the **Macro source** field will be already populated with the corresponding approval object (in this case \u2013 the \"Approvals in section Document\" object, (Fig. 11).\nFig. 11 Approval notification template settings\n![Fig.\u00a011 Approval notification template settings](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_bpmn_approval_email_template_setup.png)\n5. Click the **Edit** button. The template will open in the content designer.\nnote\nBasic instructions on working with the content designer are available in the [\"Create an email template\"](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=studio&ver=7&id=1404) article.\n6. Enter the email subject.\n7. Drag&drop a content block (e.g., **Text**) to the template. Replace the text in the **Text** block with your own.\n8. Add regular email template macros:\n1. Place your cursor in the text block, click ![btn_email_temlate_macro.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_email_temlate_macro.png) and choose **Basic macro** (Fig. 12). The **Macros selection** window opens.\nFig. 12 Accessing the macros in the content designer\n![Fig.\u00a012 Accessing the macros in the content designer](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_bpmn_approval_email_add_macro.png)\nnote\nFor users of Creatio version 7.13.2 and below, the command names are different. The command for selecting standard macros is called **Select macros** , and the **Select column** command is used to create a custom macro.\n2. In the **Macros selection** window, choose the needed macro and click **Select**. The available macros are divided into several groups.\nYou can specify data of the email recipient contact (\"Recipient\" group), information of the user who runs the approval process (\"Current user\" group) or the owner of the record being approved (\"Owner\" group). For example, to add the name of the user who submitted the document for approval, select **Current user** \u2192 **Contact name** macro (Fig. 13).\nFig. 13 Adding a macro to the email text\n![Fig.\u00a013 Adding a macro to the email text](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_bpmn_approval_email_select_macro.png)\nThe corresponding macro will be added to the email text at the insertion point.\n9. Add email template macros that are based on the \"Macro source\" object.\n1. Place your cursor in the text block, click ![btn_email_temlate_macro00039.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_email_temlate_macro00039.png) and choose **Select column**. The **Select column** window (Fig. 48) opens.\n2. In the **Select column** window, choose the column of the object (that you specified in the **Macro source** field) whose values must be added to the notification text. The \"approval\" object is automatically added once you enable approvals in the section wizard and contains data from the approval itself, e.g., Approval purpose, Approver\u2019s name, etc.\n3. You can add macros for columns of any object, provided it is linked to the \"approval\" object, e.g., you can add columns of the document being approved. To select a column of a linked object, Click **+** next to the \"approval\" object name in the **Select column** window (Fig. 14). For example, to add the approved document\u2019s type and number, add the **Type** and **Number** columns from the linked **Document** object.\nFig. 14 Selecting columns of a linked object as macros\n![Fig.\u00a014 Selecting columns of a linked object as macros](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_bpmn_howto_approval_email_object.gif)\nAs a result, your template will look like this (Fig. 15):\nFig. 15 Example of approval notification template\n![Fig. 15\u00a0Example of approval notification template](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/chapter_bpmn_approval_email_template_result.png)\n10. Save the changes in the content designer and the email template.\n11. Select the **Notify about the approval result** checkbox and populate the **Recipient** field. You can specify any Creatio contact, account or an email address. For example, you can send approval result notifications to the user who submitted the record for approval, record owner, etc.\n12. Repeat steps 3-10 to create an approval notification email template.\n13. Save the process diagram.\nAs a result, whenever a user submits a record for the approval using this process, email notifications will be sent according to the custom templates.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Work with approvals](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1833)\n[Notify an employee when they become an activity participant](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2359)",
