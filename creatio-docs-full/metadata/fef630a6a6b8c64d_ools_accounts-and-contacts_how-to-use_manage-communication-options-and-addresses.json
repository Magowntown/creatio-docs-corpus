  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1All Creatio products\nOn this page\nIn Creatio, you can manage the communication options and addresses of contacts and accounts on their form pages in the **Customer 360** app. Manage the communication options in the top left and manage the addresses on the **Contact info** tab.\nYou can use **default types** of communication options or add **custom types**. Use the **Communication option types** lookup to add custom types of communication options. Custom communication option types fall into one of the pre-set communication types specified on the page of the individual lookup record: \"Email,\" \"Phone,\" \"SMS,\" \"Social network,\" and \"Web.\" Specify the needed communication type when adding a custom communication option.\nImportant\nIf Microsoft Exchange integration is configured, we do not recommend changing the default communication option types, since this might lead to synchronization errors.\nCommunication options can have various **display formats**. The format determines the **action** executed when you click the communication option, for example, opening the email client. The following display formats are available:\n* text\n* phone\n* email\n* web\n* skype\n* twitter\n* linkedin\n* google\n* facebook\nCreatio sets the display format for new communication options to \"text\" **automatically**. You can change the format **manually** in the **Communication option types** lookup if needed.\n## Add a communication option\u200b\nUse the **Communication options** component and the **Add communication option** button to specify the communication options of a contact or account. To do this:\n1. Go to the **Contacts** or **Accounts** section and **open the needed record**.\n2. Click the **Add communication option** button and **select the option to add** :\n* **Twitter** , **LinkedIn** , **Facebook**. Social network profiles of the contact or account.\n* **Web**. Website of the contact or account.\n* **Skype**. The contact\u2019s Skype account. The field is available for contact profiles.\n* **Other phone** , **Extension phone** , **Business phone** , **Mobile phone** , **Home phone**. Phone numbers that can be used to contact the person. The fields are available for contact profiles.\n* **Fax** , **Phone** , **Alternate phone**. Phone numbers that can be used to contact the company. The fields are available for account profiles.\n* **Email**. Email address of the contact or account.\n3. **Enter data** using the standard format for this communication option.\n4. **Save the changes**.\nFig. 1 Communication options component\n![Fig.\u00a01 Communication options component](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/scr_communication_options_component.png)\n## Mark a communication option as primary\u200b\nCreatio marks one communication option per option type as **primary**. When a communication option is marked as primary, its value is synchronized with the corresponding object field if it exists, for example, **Email**. The first added communication option is marked as primary **automatically**. Creatio does not mark any other options of the same type you add later as primary. You can change the primary communication option **manually** if needed. To do this:\n1. Go to the **Contacts** or **Accounts** section and **open the needed record**.\n2. Hold the pointer over the needed communication option in the **Communication options** component \u2192 ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/btn_context_menu.png) **button**. This opens the record edit menu.\n3. **Click \"Set as primary\"** (Fig 2).\nFig. 2 Set a communication option as primary\n![Fig.\u00a02 Set a communication option as primary](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/scr_set_communication_option_as_primary.png)\n**As a result** , Creatio will mark the communication option as primary and remove the mark from the original primary communication option.\nIf you **delete** a primary communication option and other options of the same type exist, Creatio marks the newest communication option as primary.\n## Keep communication options valid\u200b\nCreatio marks newly added communication options as **valid** automatically. You can also mark communication options as **invalid** or valid manually if needed. For example, if the email address of the customer changes, you can add a new address to the detail component and mark the previous address as invalid manually. To do this:\n1. Go to the **Contacts** or **Accounts** section and **open the needed record**.\n2. Hold the pointer over an invalid email in the **Communication options** component \u2192 the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/btn_context_menu.png) **button**. This opens the record edit menu.\n3. **Click \"Mark as invalid\"** (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Mark a communication option as invalid\n![Fig.\u00a03 Mark a communication option as invalid](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/scr_mark_communication_option_as_invalid.png)\n4. **Save the changes**.\n**As a result** , Creatio will add \"invalid\" next to the field name (Fig. 4)\nFig. 4 Invalid communication option\n![Fig.\u00a04 Invalid communication option](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/scr_invalid_communication_option.png)\nDepending on the received email responses in Marketing Creatio, Creatio can **mark an email address as invalid automatically**. This occurs if the sent emails received \"Hard Bounce\" response 5 times in a row for any of the following reasons:\n* Unknown Recipient\n* Mailbox Problem\n* Spam Reject\n* Domain Not Found\nIf Creatio receives the \"Hard Bounce\" response for the \"Recipient Blocked\" reason, the email address is marked as invalid immediately.\nTo view the reasons for the response, open the email page \u2192 the **Audience** tab \u2192 the **Response reason** column.\n## Add an address\u200b\nUse the **Addresses** expanded list to specify the addresses of a contact or account. To do this:\n1. Go to the **Contacts** or **Accounts** section and **open the needed record**.\n2. Open the **Contact info** or **Account info** tab \u2192 **Addresses** expanded list \u2192 ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/CRM_Tools/communications_and_addresses_in_freedom_ui/btn_add_an_address.png) **button**. This opens a page.\n3. Fill out the following fields on the page that opens:\n1. **Specify the type of the contact or account address** in the **Address type** field. For example, \"Home\" or \"Business\" for a contact, \"Legal\" or \"Actual\" for an account. Address types are defined when a record is added, but you can change them later.\n2. **Select the**Primary** checkbox** if the address is primary. By default, the **Primary** checkbox is selected for the first address added to the **Addresses** detail, but you can select this checkbox for a different address at any time.\n3. **Enter the street, building, and apartment or office number** in the **Address** field.\n4. **Select the contact or account location** in the **City** and **Country** fields. The **State/province** and **City** fields are connected to the **Country** field. For example, if a city is located in a certain country, then when you populate the **City** field, Creatio populates the **Country** field automatically. Similarly, if you enter a province in the **State/province** field, Creatio populates the **Country** field automatically. When you fill out the **Country** field, the **State/province** and **City** fields display only the regions and cities connected to the selected country. You can connect a region to a specific country in the **States/provinces** lookup, and connect a city to a country in the **Cities** lookup.\n5. **Enter the ZIP or postal code** of the account or contact in the **ZIP/postal code** field.\nYou can open an account address to **view it on the map**. If the location of the account on the map is not correct, drag the marker to the correct position and save the changes.\nImportant\nCreatio displays addresses using the OpenStreetMap service integration.
