Basic infrastructure option without using load balancers.\n* **With fault-tolerance**. Infrastructure option that has horizontal scaling. Fault tolerance is implemented using Creatio server, database, and caching load balancers.\n## Creatio layers\u200b\nCreatio has a classic **3-tier architecture** that has the following layers: data, application, presentation.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MainApplication/scr_CreatioLevels.png)\n### Presentation layer\u200b\nThe presentation layer enables users to access the Creatio UI via a web browser or a mobile app for Android or iOS. The layer contains web pages, JavaScript code, and styles that define the **UI logic and look**.\nThe **key technologies** used here are Angular, JavaScript, Ext.JS, HTML5, CSS.\nThe **supported browsers** include Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.\nMobile Creatio is an alternative client to access the app that uses the UI optimized for Android and iOS devices.\n### Application layer\u200b\nThe application layer is implemented on .Net Platform (C#). You can deploy the layer on Windows and Linux web servers. The application layer defines the **core business logic** , such as dynamic case management, business process engine, phone integration, etc.\nThe layer handles user authentication/authorization, license checks, and instantiation. It also runs custom business logic implemented via Creatio and no-code tools.\nThis layer corresponds to the application server on the infrastructure level.\n### Data layer\u200b\nThe data layer stores and manages all customer **data** , app settings, app properties, and user authentication data.\nCreatio uses it for in-memory storage of the session data and frequently used caches, as well as quick interactions between web farm nodes.\n**Supported DBMS** :\n* Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and PostgreSQL for **on-site** deployment\n* PostgreSQL for **cloud** deployment\n**Caching server** : Redis database.\nThe layer corresponds to the caching server and database server on the infrastructure level.\n## Creatio infrastructure\u200b\nThe Creatio infrastructure includes the following **components** :\n* Application server.\n* Database server.\n* Caching server.\n* Version control system server (optional). Needed for multi-user development.\n* Mobile Creatio (optional). Opens Creatio on a mobile device.\nView the general architectural diagram of Creatio without fault tolerance in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MainApplication/7.18/scr_ArchitectureWithoutFaultTolerance.png)\nnote\nThe architecture of Creatio with fault tolerance requires load balancers, as well as additional application, Redis, and database servers.\n### Application server\u200b\nThe application server corresponds to the application layer and performs the main computations.\nCreatio supports the .Net Platform (C#). View the setup options for Creatio products in the table below.\nCreatio products| .NET Framework| .NET  \n---|---|---  \nMarketing| +| +  \nSales Enterprise| +| +  \nSales Commerce| +|   \nSales Team| +|   \nService Enterprise| +| +  \nCustomer Center| +|   \nStudio| +| +  \nLending| +|   \nBank Customer Journey| +|   \nBank Sales| +|   \nSales Enterprise & Marketing & Service Enterprise| +| +  \nSales Enterprise & Marketing & Customer Center| +|   \nSales Commerce & Marketing & Customer Center| +|   \nSales Team & Marketing| +|   \nSales Team & Marketing & Customer Center| +| +  \nBank Sales & Bank Customer Journey & Lending & Marketing| +| +  \n#### .NET Framework application server\u200b\nCreatio on **.NET Framework** runs under Microsoft Internet Information Services (**IIS**) in **Windows**.\nLearn more about the system requirements for .NET Framework Creatio product servers: [Requirements calculator](https://academy.creatio.com/requirements/calculator).\nThe .NET Framework Creatio application server consists of the following components:\n1. The **loader** (`WebAppLoader`), an application that performs Creatio service functions and redirects users to the configuration component of the main Creatio application.\nThe loader handles the following:\n* user authorization\n* license verification and user authentication\n* running the background task scheduler\nThe loader is located in the Creatio root folder on the file system level.\nAfter the application loader authenticates a request, the users can work with the configuration component.\n2. The **configuration component** (`WebApp`), an application that implements specific configuration in Creatio and handles the business logic.\nThe configuration component is located in the `Terrasoft.WebApp` folder on the file system level.\n#### .NET application server\u200b\nCreatio on **.NET** runs under **Kestrel** on **Linux** and Microsoft Internet Information Services (**IIS**) in **Windows**.\nLearn more about the system requirements for .NET Creatio product servers: [Requirements calculator](https://academy.creatio.com/requirements/calculator).\nCreatio on .NET is monolithic and serves as both the application **loader** and the **configuration component**. Learn more: [Creatio .NET products](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2453).\n### Database server\u200b\nThe database server is a part of the Creatio data layer.\nThe database stores the following data:\n* user data\n* data required for Creatio operation\n* configuration settings that determine the product functionality\nYou can use the following DBMS:\n* Microsoft SQL Server (for on-site deployment)\n* Oracle (for on-site deployment)\n* PostgreSQL (for cloud deployment)\nFind the up-to-date versions of supported DBMS in the [System requirements calculator](https://academy.creatio.com/requirements/calculator) after performing the calculations.\nView the setup options for Creatio products in the table below.\nCreatio products| Microsoft SQL| Oracle| PostgreSQL  \n---|---|---|---  \n.NET Framework| .NET  \nMarketing| +|  | +| +  \nSales Enterprise| +|  | +| +  \nSales Commerce| +|  | +|   \nSales Team| +|  | +|   \nService Enterprise| +|  | +| +  \nCustomer Center| +|  | +|   \nStudio| +|  | +| +  \nLending| +|  | +|   \nBank Customer Journey| +|  | +|   \nBank Sales| +|  | +|   \nSales Enterprise & Marketing & Service Enterprise| +| +| +| +  \nSales Enterprise & Marketing & Customer Center| +|  | +|   \nSales Commerce & Marketing & Customer Center| +|  | +|   \nSales Team & Marketing| +|  | +|   \nSales Team & Marketing & Customer Center| +|  | +| +  \nBank Sales & Bank Customer Journey & Lending & Marketing| +| +| +| +  \n### Redis caching server\u200b\nRedis is a part of the Creatio data layer. It handles the following tasks:\n* user and application data storage (user profile, session data, etc.)\n* cached data storage\n* data exchange between web farm nodes\nCreatio uses **data warehousing** to achieve these goals. This technology is based on an object class model, a unified API that manages the application's access to data in an external repository. Creatio uses Redis caching server as the external repository.\nRedis supports the following data storage strategies:\n* **Data storage in memory only**. Redis converts a persistent database to a caching server.\n* **Periodical saves to drive** (default). Redis creates a data snapshot every 1-15 minutes depending on when the previous snapshot was created and the number of modified keys.\n* **Transaction log**. Redis synchronously records each change to a special append-only log-file.\n* **Replication**. You can assign a master server to each Redis server. Redis will replicate all changes to master servers on slave servers.\nDefine the data storage strategy in Redis server configuration.\n### Version control system server (optional)\u200b\nThe version control system server is an optional Creatio component. Use this component when developing custom configurations in parallel with the normal operation of Creatio. Version control system is required for **multi-user development**. Learn more about setting up a version control system server: [Version control system for development environments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2321) (user documentation).\nThe version control server handles the following functions:\n* **Migrating changes between Creatio applications during the development**. The version control system transfers changes via packages stored as sets of files and directories on the file system level.\n* **Storing the configuration status as packages of a specific version**. The version control system stores all configuration elements that you develop in the packages.\nThe Creatio IDE is designed to work with Subversion, but you can use other version control systems when developing in third-party IDEs.\n## Horizontal scaling\u200b\nYou can enhance the performance of large-scale Creatio projects through horizontal scaling. Use horizontal scaling for a Creatio instance that has fault-tolerance.\nThe Creatio instance that has fault tolerance includes the following **components** :\n* Load balancer. The load balancer can be either hardware or software. To work in fault-tolerant mode, use an HTTP/HTTPS traffic balancer that supports WebSocket protocol. Learn more about installing and setting up the balancer: [Application server web farm](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2110) (user documentation).\n* Web farm (multiple application servers).\n* Caching server that uses the [Redis Cluster](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2349) mechanism (multiple Redis caching servers).\n* Database server or database cluster (multiple database servers).\n* Version control system server (optional).\nView the general architectural diagram of Creatio with horizontal scaling in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/MainApplication/7.18/scr_WebFarmArchitecture.png)\n## Deployment options\u200b\nCreatio supports the following deployment options:\n* on-site (deploy the Creatio instance on the customer's local servers)\n* cloud (deploy the Creatio instance in the cloud)\n### On-site deployment\u200b\nWhen deploying Creatio on-site, the customer is responsible for all server infrastructure expenses, including the installation, configuration, maintenance, and administration.\nOn-site deployment **advantages** :\n* Fast and convenient development.\n* Independent development environments. Since development is performed in a separate Creatio instance, it cannot affect other users.\n* Version control system lets you save and migrate changes.\n* IDE and continuous integration pipeline setup are supported.\nOn-site deployment **constraints** :\n* Dedicated servers are required to deploy Creatio components.\n* Continuous updates, debugging, infrastructure administration are required.\nWhen deploying Creatio on-site, make sure that both Creatio servers and client computers meet the system requirements. To calculate server parameters required to deploy Creatio and containerized components, use the [System requirements calculator](https://academy.creatio.com/requirements/calculator).\nLearn more about Creatio on-site deployment and setup stages on Windows or Linux: [On-site deployment](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/category/on-site-deployment) (user documentation).\n### Cloud deployment\u200b\nIn the cloud mode, Creatio is deployed on cloud data center servers (Amazon, Azure) managed by Creatio. Both servers and data are physically located in the data centers. Creatio handles all issues related to administration, speed, or scalability. The customers only use the client part of Creatio.\nCloud deployment **advantages** :\n* Timely updates.\n* Maximum performance.\n* Compliance with industry standards on data availability and security.\nCloud deployment **constraints** :\n* Creatio in the cloud must comply with the set of requirements. Learn more: [Development environment](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15201&anchor=title-2124-1).\n* Creatio in the cloud supports PostgreSQL only.\nYou can deploy Creatio cloud from a [trial version](https://www.creatio.com/trial/creatio) available on our website. During the 14-days trial period, you can get familiar with the main features of the application. After the trial period ends, the demo version can be migrated to the main Creatio platform.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Environment overview](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15201)\n[Requirements calculator](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/requirements/calculator)\n[Version control system for development environments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2321) (user documentation)\n[Packages basics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15121)\n[Application server web farm](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2110) (user documentation)\n[Creatio .NET Core products](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=2341) (user documentation)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[PostgreSQL downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)\n[Redis caching server documentation](https://redis.io/documentation)\n[On-site deployment Creatio documentation](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/8.0/category/on-site-deployment)\n[Version control system Creatio documentation](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/8.0/category/version-control-tools)\n* * *\n## E-learning courses\u200b\n[Creatio architecture basics](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531057/takecourse)\n[Setting up a development environment](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531132/takecourse)",
