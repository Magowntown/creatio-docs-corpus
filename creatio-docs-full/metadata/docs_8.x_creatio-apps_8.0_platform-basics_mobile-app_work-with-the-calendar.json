In the **calendar** mode the tasks which you are responsible for, and those in which you were added to **Participants** detail, are displayed. In the **list** mode, only the tasks for which you are responsible are displayed. You can select the view (drop-down list or calendar) in the upper area of the workspace area.\nFig. 1 Activities section of mobile application\n![Fig.\u00a01 Activities section of mobile application](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/scr_activity_section_list.png)\nDepending on the size of your mobile device screen, the default calendar view is for the current day or the current week. If necessary, you can change the display period of the schedule.\nTo change the display period for tasks in the calendar, tap ![scr_activity_period_button.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/scr_activity_period_button.png) and select the required time interval.\nTap anywhere on the blank calendar space and swipe right to go to the next day or left to go to the previous day.\nnote\nThe calendar view period can differ due to the work limitations of different mobile devices. For tablets: the schedule in the **Activities** section can be changed to weekly or daily mode. For mobile phones, the schedule is always displayed daily in portrait view and weekly in landscape view.\nThe current time is indicated with an orange line.\nIn the calendar area, all activities are displayed as rectangular blocks whose height corresponds to the duration of the activity.\nOn the left side of the calendar area, time intervals are displayed.\nActivities in the calendar view are highlighted with different colors depending on their status and due date.\n* Activities are highlighted in red when their due time has already passed and are not in the final state yet.\n* Activities are highlighted blue when their due time hasn't passed and are not in the final state yet (scheduled or in progress)\n* Grey is used to highlighting activities that are in the final state (completed or canceled).\n## View someone else's calendar\u200b\nThe ability to view the calendar of another owner is only available in online mode.\nTo view the calendar of another owner:\n1. Tap the **Edit** button in the upper right corner of the mobile application ([Fig. 2](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_57825_222))\nFig. 2 Changing owner to view the calendar\n![Fig.\u00a02 Changing owner to view the calendar](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/scr_activity_change_profile.png)\n2. Select an owner in the drop-down list.\n3. To get back to your calendar tap the **My activities** button in the owner's drop-down list.\n## Add a task\u200b\nTo create a new task in the **Activities** section, tap the ![btn_add_from_list.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/btn_add_from_list.png) button. Then, fill in the required information and tap **Save**.\nWhen working in the mobile application you can create multi-day tasks (tasks lasting for more than one day).\nTo create a multi-day task:\n1. Highlight a task in the calendar.\n2. Drag a task to the panel with the days of the week.\n3. Hold the small circle on the corner of the activity bar ![btn_mobile_end_activity.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/btn_mobile_end_activity.png) and drag it to expand the activity to the required range ([Fig. 3](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_22178_227)).\nFig. 3 Creating a multi-day task\n![Fig.\u00a03 Creating a multi-day task](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/scr_activity_create_activity_days.png)\n## Task actions\u200b\nYou can change the duration of an activity. To do this, tap the activity, hold the circle at the corner of the activity (![btn_mobile_change_time.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/btn_mobile_change_time.png)), and drag it to the required time. To move an activity to another time, drag it to the required time interval.\nTo change the task status, go to the activity edit mode and select the required value in the **Status** field.\nIf you need to mark a task as completed, tap the button in the calendar and then tap the ![btn_mobile_change_status.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/btn_mobile_change_status.png) button.\nTo return a task to its initial state, select it in the calendar and tap ![btn_mobile_change_status_work.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/btn_mobile_change_status_work.png) ([Fig. 4](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_52292_228)).\nFig. 4 Changing status of a completed task\n![Fig.\u00a04 Changing status of a completed task](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/scr_activity_chande_activity_done.png)\nThe actions menu is used for **copying** , **deleting** , and **splitting** tasks. To view the options, highlight a task and tap ![btn_mobile_card_menu.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/btn_mobile_card_menu.png).\nYou can split an activity based on the time of the end and the beginning of overlapping tasks.\nWhen copying a task from the calendar, the **Participants** details are also copied. When copying from the activity page a new page is created in which you can fill in all the required information.\nIn the online mode, you can also display **activities created in the Creatio main application**. To do this, use the **Refresh** action.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Work with service cases in the mobile app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2315)\n[Work with dashboards in the mobile app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2314)\n[Mobile application FAQ](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1668)",
