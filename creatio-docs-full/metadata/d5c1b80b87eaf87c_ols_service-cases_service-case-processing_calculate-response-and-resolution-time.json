  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Creatio Service\nOn this page\nCase pages display response and resolution deadlines as well as remaining time until the resolution or the overdue time if the scheduled date has already passed (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Case page that has response and resolution time calculated\n![Fig. 1 Case page that has response and resolution time calculated](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_section_service_requests_case_page.png)\n## Calculate the response and resolution time for cases\u200b\nCreatio calculates the response and resolution deadlines of a case based on several factors. When a case moves to the next stage of its life cycle, Creatio recalculates the resolution deadline. You can also view the time already spent on the case resolution as well as the time remaining until the resolution deadline. The response time does not update after the case changes its status, i. e., the actual response occurs.\n## Overdue/remaining time timers\u200b\nThe case page includes special timers that visualize the progress in case processing. They are available next to the **Actual response time** and **Actual resolution time** fields (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 Overdue/remaining time timers\n![Fig. 2 Overdue/remaining time timers](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_overdue_indicators.png)\nThe timer appearance depends on the current status of the case and its compliance with the deadlines. The time is always calculated in calendar units (minutes, hours, days).\nDepending on case resolution time:\n* Prior to the deadline, the timer is green and displays the remaining time.\n* After the deadline, the timer is red and displays the overdue time.\nThe timer is displayed as long as either of the following conditions is met\n* \"Response\" and \"Resolution time\" fields are populated.\n* \"Actual response\" and \"Actual resolution time\" fields are empty.\n## Calculation rules for response and resolution time\u200b\nThe response and resolution deadlines are calculated based on the following data:\n* case\n* service agreement\n* service\n* service in service agreement\n* corresponding calendar\nYou can set up contingency plans for deadline calculation using several pre-defined calculation strategies:\n* by service\n* by case priority\n* by service in SLA\nCreatio uses one of the rules by default, while other rules can be alternative rules. If Creatio is unable to calculate the deadline using the default rule, it attempts to use the alternative rule. If the alternative rule cannot be used and if it has its own alternative rule, Creatio uses that rule. If an alternative rule is not specified, Creatio does not calculate the deadlines. Set the default and alternative rules in the **Case deadline calculation schemas** lookup. Learn more: [ Set up response and resolution deadlines](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654)\nnote\nDevelopers can code new rules if needed.\n#### By service in SLA\u200b\nThis rule is based on the values in the **Response time** and **Resolution time** fields on the **Available services in contract** expanded list of the service agreement page (Fig. 5) and the calendar of the service agreement. You can also select a specific calendar for service in contract if it differs from the calendar of the service agreement.\nFig. 5 Data required to calculate deadlines by service in SLA\n![Fig. 5 Data required to calculate deadlines by service in SLA](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_by_service_in_sla_rule.png)\nIn this case, the specified calendar will be used when calculating the response and resolution time. Otherwise, the response time will be calculated according to the calendar in service agreement. If the service agreement contains no calendar, the time will be calculated according to the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting.\n#### By service\u200b\nThis deadline calculation rule is based on the service page data and the service calendar (Fig. 3). If the service contains no calendar, Creatio uses the value in the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting\nFig. 3 Data required to calculate deadlines by service\n![Fig. 3 Data required to calculate deadlines by service](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_by_service_rule.png)\n#### By priority\u200b\nTo calculate deadlines by this rule, Creatio uses the **Case priorities** lookup data and the calendar from the service in service agreement or \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting. This rule is based on the response and resolution deadlines set for different case priorities (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Data required to calculate deadlines by priority\n![Fig. 4 Data required to calculate deadlines by priority](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/calculate_response_and_resolution_time/scr_by_priority_rule.png)\n## Examples of response and resolution time calculation rules\u200b\nThis section covers how calculation rules for response and resolution deadlines affect actual case deadlines. For these examples, the **customer and support are in the same time zone**.\nnote\nIf the response and resolution time is specified in calendar time (minutes, hours or days), the service calendar does not affect the deadline calculation. If the response and resolution time is specified in working hours or workdays, the service calendar will be taken into account. The deadline for response and resolution time specified in workdays is calculated from the start of the next working day. For example, if a case was registered at 1:00 PM and the response time is 1 workday, the planned response time is set to the end of the work interval of the next working day. When Creatio recalculates deadlines, for example, after reopening a case, a full working day is deducted from the remaining time.\n#### Calculate response and resolution deadlines using the \"By service\" rule\u200b\nCreatio takes the parameters configured on the service page and the calendar of the service into account when calculating response and resolution deadlines **by service**. If the service contains no calendar, Creatio uses the value in the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting. Case priority is not taken into account.\nExample\nThe \"Consultations on software setup\" service has the following parameters:\nResponse time unit: 1 working hour.\nResolution time unit: 3 working hours.\nService calendar: 5-day work week (from Monday to Friday), business hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, no lunch break.\nAs a result, response and resolution deadlines for all cases connected to the \"Consultations on software setup\" service will be calculated in the same way regardless of all other case parameters.\nFor cases received on Monday, 10:00 AM, the deadlines are calculated in the following way:\n* Response deadline: Monday. 11:00 AM (registration time + response time unit).\n* Resolution deadline: Monday. 1:00 PM (registration time + resolution time unit).\n#### Calculate response and resolution deadlines using the \"By priority\" rule\u200b\nCreatio takes the case priority and the calendar from the service in service level agreement, service agreement, or \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting into account when calculating response and resolution deadlines **by priority**. Service is not taken into account.\nExample\nThe **Case priorities** lookup has the following settings for critical priority:\nResponse time unit: 30 working minutes.\nResolution time unit: 2 working hours.\nService calendar of the service agreement: 5-day work week (from Monday to Friday), business hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, no lunch break.\nAs a result, response and resolution deadlines for all cases of \"Critical\" priority will be calculated in the same way.\nFor cases of \"Critical\" priority received on Monday, 10:00 AM, the deadlines are calculated in the following way:\n* Response deadline: Monday. 10:30 AM (registration time + response time unit).\n* Resolution deadline: Monday. 12:00 PM (registration time + resolution time unit).\n#### Calculate response and resolution deadlines using the \"By service in SLA\" rule\u200b\nCreatio takes parameters configured for specific service in the service agreement and the calendar in service agreement when calculating response and resolution deadlines **by service in SLA**. If the service agreement contains no calendar, the time will be calculated according to the \"Base calendar\" (\"BaseCalendar\" code) system setting. Case priority and parameters on the service page are not taken into account.\nExample\nThe \"Consultations on software setup\" service in the \"4 \u2013 Axiom\" service agreement has the following settings:\nResponse time unit: 4 working hours.\nResolution time unit: 1 working day.\nService calendar: 5-day work week (from Monday to Friday), business hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, no lunch break.\nFor the case received from the Axiom employee for the \"Consultations on software setup\" service that is included in the \"4 \u2013 Axiom\" service agreement on Monday, 10:00 AM, the deadlines are calculated in the following way:\n* Response deadline: Monday. 2:00 PM (registration time + response time unit).\n* Resolution deadline: Tuesday. 6:00 PM (registration time + resolution time unit).\n#### Calculate response and resolution deadlines for customers who are in the same time zone as the support service\u200b\nCreatio uses the calendar data in the service or service agreement. Configure the calendar in the **Calendars** lookup. Learn more: [Set up response and resolution deadlines](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654).\nExample\nThe **service calendar** has the following parameters:\n* Work week from Monday to Friday.\n* Working hours from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, break from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.\n* Days off: Saturday, Sunday.\n* Additional day off: May 1.\n* The time zone is UTC -5.\nCreatio calculates the deadlines in the time zone of the corresponding service calendar. The results are adjusted based on the time zone of the viewer.\nSupport agent and customer are in the same time zone (UTC -5).\nView the examples that calculate deadlines for a case created during weekend and a workday below.

If the user profile does not have a time zone specified, Creatio uses the time zone from the \"Default TimeZone\" (\"DefaultTimeZone\" code) system setting. If the user profile and \"Default TimeZone\" (\"DefaultTimeZone\" code) system setting do not have time zones specified, Creatio uses the server local time to determine the time zone.\nView the examples that calculate deadlines for a case created during weekend and a workday below.
