  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.1All Creatio products\nOn this page\nUse folders to organize and segment your records. Setting up folders will help you to easily find the necessary records among your data. For example, in the **Contacts** section, you can create a \"New customers\" folder that will filter records by the contact type (\"Customer\") and the record date (\"Current month\"). If you select a folder within a section, only the records that match folder filter conditions will be displayed. You can add your most frequently used folders to your favorites.\nA section record can be included in one or more folders.\nThe folders can have a tree-like structure and contain both parent and subordinate folders. The folder structure does not affect the contents of the folders. For example, if a record is included in one of the subordinate folders, it does not necessarily mean it is included in the parent folder.\nYou can create the necessary folder structure and specify your own rules for the folder contents. The procedures for creating static and dynamic folders are different. Deleting a folder will not result in deleting the records contained in it.\nYou can also configure individual list settings for each folder within the folder tree. Learn more: [Manage a list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2402).\n## Dynamic folders\u200b\n**Dynamic folders** (indicated with the ![](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/icn_dynamic_folder.png) icon) contain only those section records that match the specified filter conditions. For example, you can create a \"New customers\" dynamic folder for records filtered by the creation date.\nRecords cannot be manually included in or excluded from dynamic folders. A record will be displayed in a dynamic folder only if it matches the folder filter. If the record no longer meets the folder filter, it will automatically be excluded from that folder.\nFor example, your \"Competitors\" folder filters the records by the account type (\"Competitors\"). Thus, the companies for which the \"Competitor\" value is specified will be automatically included in the folder. If the company type changes, the record will automatically be excluded from that folder.\nTo **create a dynamic folder** that has the corresponding filter conditions:\n1. **Click the Add** button in the folder tree.\nFig. 1 Add a folder\n![Fig.\u00a01\u00a0Add a folder](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_add_dynamic_folder.png)\n2. **Select Add folder** in the button menu in the sections where the static folders are available. The new folder will appear in the folder tree.\nFig. 2 Add a dynamic folder\n![Fig.\u00a02\u00a0Add a dynamic folder](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_add_dynamic_folder_crm.png)\n3. **Add the name** of the folder in the automatically selected field. The new folder displays all the records in the current section.\nFig. 3 Newly created dynamic folder\n![Fig.\u00a03\u00a0Newly created dynamic folder](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_new_dynamic_folder.png)\n4. Click the ![](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/btn_open_filter.png) button to the right of the folder name to **add filter**.\nFig. 4 Add folder filter\n![Fig.\u00a04\u00a0Add folder filter](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/sct_folders_set_up_filter.png)\n5. **Set up filter conditions** and click the **Save** button.. Filter condition setup is identical to the [advanced filter](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017#title-1755-10) setup.\nFig. 5 Folder filter setup area\n![Fig.\u00a05\u00a0Folder filter setup area](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_filter_conditions.png)\n**As a result** , all the records that meet the filter conditions will appear automatically in the section list when you select the folder.\nYou can **copy the necessary folder** if you need to create a folder whose filter conditions are partially identical to one of the existing folders. You can also copy the original folder access rights if necessary. To do this, select **Copy** in the menu of the necessary folder.\n## Static folders\u200b\n**Static folders** (indicated with the ![](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/icn_static%20folder.png) icon) include only those section records that have been added to these folders manually or via converting from the dynamic folder. \"VIP\" or \"Blacklist\" are examples of static folders because the decision to include certain customers into such folders is made for each record individually. Static folders can be used to group other folders. \nImportant\nWhile some sections within Marketing Creatio and composable apps that belong to marketing functionality offer out-of-the-box static folder functionality, others require additional setup using no-code tools. This means you might need to manually configure static folders in specific sections or products to organize records effectively. Learn more: [Set up folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2540).\n### Create a static folder\u200b\nStatic folders are only available in some Creatio sections. You can create a static folder in the following ways:\n* Add a folder and fill it with records manually.\n* Copy the folder content from a dynamic folder.\n#### Add a static folder manually\u200b\n1. **Open the folder area** in the section by clicking the **Folders** button.\n2. **Click Add** , the menu will appear.\n3. **Select** the **Add static folder** command (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Creating a static folder\n![Fig.\u00a06 Creating a static folder](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_add_static_folder.png)\nnote\nThe **Add** button menu is only displayed for sections where you can create a static folder.\n4. **Enter the folder name**.\n**As a result** , the new static folder will be added in the section. You need to populate this folder manually by selecting the required records and running the **Add to folder** action. Learn more: Add records to a static folder.\n#### Convert a dynamic folder into a static folder\u200b\n1. **Open the folder area** in the section by clicking the **Folders** button.\n2. **Select a dynamic folder** whose content to include in a static folder.\n3. **Click** ![btn_folders_show_actions_8.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/btn_folders_show_actions_8.png) \u2192 **Convert to static folder** option.\nFig. 7 Convert the dynamic folder to static\n![Fig.\u00a07\u00a0Convert the dynamic folder to static](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_convert_to_static_folder.png)\n4. **Enter the new folder name**.\n**As a result** , the static folder will appear as a subfolder of the selected dynamic folder. The content of the folders will be identical at the moment of conversion. You can include or exclude records using the **Add to folder** action. Learn more:Add records to a static folder.\nThe **Convert to static folder** action does not affect the content of the original dynamic folder.\n### Add records to a static folder\u200b\n1. **Open the folder area** in the section by clicking the **Folders** button.\n2. **Select one or more records** you want to add to the static folder. The actions menu will appear.\n3. **Click Add to static folder** (Fig. 8). This opens the window that contains the list of static folders available in the current section.\nFig. 8 Add records to static folder\n![Fig.\u00a08\u00a0Add records to static folder](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_add_to_static_folder.png)\n4. **Select** the needed static folder and click **Select**.\n**As a result** , selected records will be added to the static folder.\n### Remove records from a static folder\u200b\n1. **Open the folder area** in the section by clicking the **Folders** button.\n2. **Select the static folder** you want to edit.\n3. **Select one or more records** you want to remove from the static folder. The actions menu will appear.\n4. Click ![btn_actions_menu_more.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/btn_actions_menu_more.png) \u2192 **Remove from static folder** (Fig. 9). This opens the window that contains the list of static folders available in the current section.\nFig. Remove records from static folder\n![Fig.\u00a0Remove records from static folder](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_remove_from_static_folder.png)\n## Add folders to favorites\u200b\nYou can add the most frequently used folders to the list of favorites. Both static and dynamic folders can be added to the list.\nTo add a folder to favorites, select it in the folder tree and click the ![btn_folder_favorite_8.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/btn_folder_favorite_8.png) button (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Add a folder to favorites\n![ Fig.\u00a09\u00a0Add a folder to favorites](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_add_to_favorites.png)\nAll added folders are displayed as subordinate to the \"Favorite\" folder in the folder area. In addition, the favorite folders become available at the top of the folder tree (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Select the favorite folder in the Filter menu\n![ Fig.\u00a010\u00a0Select the favorite folder in the Filter menu](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/folders/scr_folders_favorites.png)\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Tags](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1881)\n[Manage a list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2402)\n[Set up a Folder component](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2540)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Creatio interface overview](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531087/takecourse)",
