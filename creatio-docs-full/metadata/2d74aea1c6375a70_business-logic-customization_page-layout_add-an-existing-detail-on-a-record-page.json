  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nYou can change the details on section pages and add existing details to a page. An \"existing detail\" is a page element that has been created and configured in the Detail Wizard. Learn more: [Create a detail to add it to a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2032&anchor=title-150-3).\nnote\nSince Creatio 8.3.1, Section and Detail Wizards for Classic UI are no longer available for creating new sections and details. These tools will be deprecated in future releases. We recommend using the modern Freedom UI tools that provide a more flexible and future-ready experience. Learn more: [Overview of Freedom UI Designer and its elements](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2376&ver=8.0).\n## Add an existing detail to a record page.\u200b\nExample\nDisplay the out-of-the-box **Activities** detail in the custom **Requests** section.\nLearn more about creating and configuring a section in the [Add a new section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1245) article.\nTo add a detail to a section page:\n1. Open the relevant section, e. g., **Requests**.\n2. Click **View** \u2192 **Open Section Wizard**.\n3. In the **Section pages** block of the Section Wizard:\n1. click **Edit page** if you have only one edit page in your section\n2. click **the link to the relevant page** if there are several pages in the section (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Selecting a section page from the list\n![Fig.\u00a01 Selecting a section page from the list](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_section_wizard_multiple_section_pages.png)\n4. Open the tab where you would like to place the detail. For example, **Processing**.\n5. Click **New detail**.\n6. Specify the detail settings in the dialog box (Fig. 2):\nFig. 2 Detail dialog box\n![Fig.\u00a02 Detail dialog box](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/scr_section_wizard_add_detail_window_activity.png)\n1. In the **Detail** field, select the detail to add to the page.\nnote\nIf the relevant detail is not available, the object you would like to use might not be registered as a detail yet. Use the **Advanced settings** section to check if the detail schema and related configuration elements exist. If not, create the detail. Learn more: [Add a detail based on an existing object](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2032&anchor=title-150-1).\n2. Use the **Title** field to specify the detail\u2019s title to display on the page.\n3. Use the **Where detail column** field to specify the detail object\u2019s column to filter the detail records. This is a lookup column that uses the current section\u2019s object as a lookup. The name of this column usually matches that of the section object. For example, select \"Request\" in the **Where detail column** to connect the **Equipment request** detail to the **Requests** section.\n4. Use the **Equals to page column** field to specify the section object\u2019s column to filter the detail records. Normally, this is the **Id** column. That way, a detail will only display the records where the value of the **Request** column matches that of the current section record\u2019s Id column. In other words, the detail will only display the equipment connected to the current request.\nnote\nIf the object can only be connected to the current section\u2019s object via a single column, Creatio populates the field with the value of that column.\n7. Click **Save** \u2192 **Section wizard** \u2192 **Save**.\nAs a result, a new **Activity** detail will be added to the request page.\n## Edit an existing detail on a record page\u200b\n### Change a detail\u2019s settings\u200b\nTo **change a detail\u2019s settings** or **edit its name** on the record page:\n1. Open the relevant section, e. g., **Requests**.\n2. Select any record in the section list and click **Open**.\n3. Click **View** \u2192 **Open Section Wizard**.\n4. Open the tab with the detail to edit.\n5. Select the detail and click ![btn_chapter_content_designer_htlm_element_edit.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/ui_business_logic_customization/BPMonlineHelp/add_existing_detail_on_page/btn_chapter_content_designer_htlm_element_edit.png). You can edit the detail\u2019s title displayed on the record page and the detail\u2019s record display parameters (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Editing an existing detail on a record page\n![Fig.\u00a03 Editing an existing detail on a record page](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/page_layout/gif_detail_wizard_edit_detail_properties.gif)\nnote\nThe title changed in the **Title** field on the Section Wizard\u2019s edit page will be available only on the pages of the corresponding section.\n### Set up the detail\u2019s appearance\u200b\n1. Open the relevant section, e. g., **Requests**.\n2. Select any record in the section list and click **Open**.\n3. Open the tab with the detail to set up.\n4.

Select the **Make the list editable** checkbox to make the detail\u2019s data editable directly from the list without the need to open a new page.
