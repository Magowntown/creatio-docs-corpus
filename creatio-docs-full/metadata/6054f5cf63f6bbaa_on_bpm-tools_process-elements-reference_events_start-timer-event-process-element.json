The parameters of the **Start timer** event will differ depending on the selected option.\nThe base settings of the element are different depending on the frequency. Additional parameters are available for all frequency options (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Start timer element setup area with common parameters\n![Fig.\u00a01 Start timer element setup area with common parameters](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_universal.png)\n**Process start time** \u2013 the time at which the process will start.\n**Timer validity** \u2013 the life cycle of the **Start timer** event, i.e., a time period during which the event is considered relevant and can be triggered. Populate these fields if you need to limit the period during which the **Start timer** event can be triggered for a process e.g., if you need the process to run every Friday for the next five weeks only).\n**Repeat on misfire** \u2013 select this checkbox to ensure that the process launches even if the **Start timer** element cannot be triggered at the intended time, e.g., due to a server reboot.\n**Time zone** \u2013 the time zone of the **Start timer** element. By default, the element time zone is set according to:\n* The time zone of the user who created a campaign.\n* The time zone specified in the **Default TimeZone** system setting (if no time zone has been set in the user profile).\nIf the time zone cannot be set according to the rules above, the **Time zone** field of a new campaign will have the \"(GMT) UTC Time Format\" default value.\n## Parameters of the \"Once\" frequency option\u200b\nSelect the \"Once\" frequency option in the **Process launch frequency** to run the business process only once at a specified time (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 The Start timer event setup for one-time process launch\n![Fig.\u00a02 The Start timer event setup for one-time process launch](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_once.png)\n**Launch on** \u2013 the time at which the process will start.\n## Parameters of the \"Minute/hour\" frequency option\u200b\nSelect the \"Minute/Hour\" option in the **Process launch frequency** field to launch the process several times a day (e.g., working hours) (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 The Start timer event setup for running the process every hour from 8 am till 8 pm\n![Fig.\u00a03 The Start timer event setup for running the process every hour from 8 am till 8 pm](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_m_h.png)\n**Run every** \u2013 a process launch frequency in minutes or hours, as well as a time frame the process will be limited to. For example, you can run the process every hour from 8 am till 8 pm.\n## Parameters of the \"Day\" frequency option\u200b\nIf you select the \"Day\" option in the **Process launch frequency** field to launch the business process once a day at a certain time with specific intervals (e.g., every three days) (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 The Start timer event setup for running the process every three days at 11 am\n![Fig.\u00a04 The Start timer event setup for running the process every three days at 11 am](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_day.png)\n**Run every** \u2013 a launch frequency in days and a launch time. For example, you can run a process every three days at 11 am.\n## Parameters of the \"Week\" frequency option\u200b\nSelect the \"Week\" option in the **Process launch frequency** field to repeat the business process weekly on specified days at the specified time (Fig. 5). \nFig. 5 The Start timer event setup for running the process every Tuesday and Thursday at 9 am\n![Fig.\u00a05 The Start timer event setup for running the process every Tuesday and Thursday at 9 am](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_week.png)\n**Launch on** \u2013 the time at which the process will be launched (e.g., 9:00 am).\n**Which days of the week to run?** \u2013 select weekdays on which the process must start.\n## Parameters of the \"Month\" frequency option\u200b\nSelect the \"Month\" option in the **Process launch frequency** field to launch the business process monthly at certain days (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 The Start timer event setup for running the process monthly\n![Fig.\u00a06 The Start timer event setup for running the process monthly](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_month.png)\n**Run every** \u2013 enter a time gap in months between each process launch. For example, you can automatically run the process every third month.\n**Start day** \u2013 specify the launch day of the process. You can choose from the following options:\n* \"Day of the month\" is a specific day of month (e.g., every tenth of the month). For example, every tenth of the month.\n* \"Day of the week\" is the number and the day of the week of the month (e.g., every third Friday of the month).\n* \"First / last work day\" is the first or last business/regular day of the month.\n## Parameters of the \"Year\" frequency option\u200b\nSelect the \"Year\" option in the **Process launch frequency** field to run the business process every year on a certain date at the specified time (Fig. 7).\nFig. 7 The Start timer event setup for running the process every third Monday of October every year\n![Fig.\u00a07 The Start timer event setup for running the process every third Monday of October every year](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_year.png)\n**Start day** \u2013 select the day and the month when the process will start. For example, 8th of March or every third Monday of October.\n**Launch on** \u2013 the time at which the process will be launched (e.g., 9:00 am).\n**Timer validity** \u2013 the life cycle of the **Start timer** event, i.e., a time period during which the event is considered relevant and can be triggered.\n**Repeat on misfire** \u2013 select this checkbox to ensure that the process launches even if the **Start timer** element cannot be triggered at the intended time, e.g., due to a server reboot.\n## Parameters of the \"Other frequency\" option\u200b\nSelect the \"Other frequency\" option in the **Process launch frequency** field to set a custom process frequency via a cron-expression (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 The Start timer event configured to launch a process from 14:00 to 14:59 and from 18:00 to 18:59 daily\n![Fig.\u00a08 The Start timer event configured to launch a process from 14:00 to 14:59 and from 18:00 to 18:59 daily](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_designer/scr_chapter_process_designer_start_timer_cron.png)\nnote\nCron is a planning utility widely used in UNIX-based operating systems. You can configure a more flexible launch date of a process using cron-expressions. We recommend consulting with your company\u2019s system administrators before working with cron-expressions.\nA cron-expression consists of numbers, words and symbols placed in a strictly defined order to specify the time, date, and year of the process launch. The following table shows a basic structure of cron-expressions:\nTIME UNITS| ACCEPTABLE VALUES| SPECIAL CHARACTERS  \n---|---|---  \nSecond| 0| , - * /  \nMinute| 0-59| , - * /  \nHour| 0-23| , - * /  \nDay of the month| 1-31| , - * ? / L W  \nMonth| 1-12 or JAN-DEC| , - * /  \nDay of the week| 1-7 or SUN-SAT| , - * ? / L #  \nYear| empty value or 1970-2099| , - * /  \nnote\nIf the cron-expression is correct, you will see the time/date of the process launch in the traditional format in the **Cron-expression** field. If the expression is incorrect, Creatio will display an error.\n## Examples of cron-expressions\u200b\n`0 * 14 * * ?` \u2013 launches the process every minute from 14:00 to 14:59 daily.\n`0 0/5 14,18 * * ?` \u2013 launches the process every 5 minutes from 14:00 to 14:59 and from 18:00 to 18:59 daily.\n`0 10,44 14 ? 3 WED` \u2013 launches at 14:10 and 14:44 every Wednesday of March.\n`0 0 12 1/5 * ?` \u2013 launches the process at 12:00 every 5 days, starting from the first day of the month on a monthly basis.\nLearn more about cron expressions in the [QARTZ documentation](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html).\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Process events](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2318)\n[Use events in a business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7079)",
