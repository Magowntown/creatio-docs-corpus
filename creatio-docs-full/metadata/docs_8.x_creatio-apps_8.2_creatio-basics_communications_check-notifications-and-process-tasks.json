This section displays notifications about activities or invoices, comments to your records or mentions in a corporate social network, as well as system notifications. The number on the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/images/2020-11/btn_com_esn_feedback_tab_0.png) button displays the total number of new messages in the notification center. Creatio displays the information messages on separate tabs:\n* ![btn_com_notification_center_reminders.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_reminders.png) \u2013 activity and invoice reminders created for you.\n* ![btn_com_notification_center_feed.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_feed.png) \u2013 notifications about events connected to your posts in the corporate social network. For example, you were mentioned in a post, received comments on your record in the feed, or somebody liked the record.\n* ![btn_com_notification_center_approvals.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_approvals.png) \u2013 approval notifications. For example, pending contracts.\n* ![btn_com_notification_center_noteworthy_events.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_noteworthy_events.png) \u2013 notifications about the noteworthy events of contacts and accounts.\n* ![btn_com_notification_center_system_notifications.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_system_notifications.png) \u2013 system messages about completed actions in Creatio. For example, information about data import results.\nReminders and approval notifications are active until they are processed Feed notifications, messages about noteworthy events, and system notifications are considered read when you open the corresponding tab. The history of read notifications is stored on the tab for a month since their creation. Creatio does not add the read notifications to the tab count nor the common notification center count.\nnote\nYou can modify the storage period for read notifications in the \"Notification storage period (days)\" (\"NotificationsExpirationTerm\" code) system setting. The period is 30 days by default.\n## Pop-up notifications\u200b\nCreatio displays the notification center's information messages in the browser **pop-up boxes**. The box is displayed only once when you receive the message. The notifications received after logging out of Creatio will be displayed in the pop-up boxes upon the next login.\nnote\nYour browser may ask you for permission to display pop-up boxes. If you cannot see the boxes, check the browser settings.\nClick the **x** button in the pop-up box to hide a notification. If you do this, Creatio will consider the notification unread and add it to the number of unread notifications on the corresponding tab.\nClick the notification banner in the pop-up box to open the page for which the notification was sent.\nClick the **Notification settings** button in your user profile and clear the **Enable popups** checkbox to **disable** pop-up notifications.\n## Reminders\u200b\nCreatio displays all due reminders on a separate tab in the notification center. Go to the ![btn_com_notification_center_reminders00003.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_reminders00003.png) tab to view the reminders. The number in the tab displays the total number of your active (unprocessed) reminders.\nCreate a reminder on the invoice or activity page by selecting the checkbox in the **Reminders** field group.\nThe reminders display **activities** of any category (\"Meeting,\" \"To do,\" etc.) that meet the corresponding criteria:\n* You are the owner or the author of the activity.\n* The activity has the \"Not started\" or \"In progress\" status.\n* You or any other system user created a reminder about this activity for you.\nThe **invoices** that meet the following criteria are also displayed in the reminders:\n* You are the owner of the invoice.\n* The invoice has the \"Draft,\" \"Unpaid\" or \"Partially paid\" status.\n* You or any other system user created a reminder about this invoice for you.\nThe reminders include the title of the activity or the invoice number, the date, as well as the customer of an activity or an invoice. Creatio also displays a category icon for activities. For example, meetings or calls.\nThe key details in the reminder are displayed as hyperlinks. For example, click the task title to view its page.\n### Create a reminder\u200b\nCreate reminders for invoices and activities in the **Reminders** field group of the record page. To create a reminder for the activity:\n1. Open the page of the relevant activity.\n2. Select the checkbox in the **Reminders** field block:\n1. Select the **Remind owner** checkbox to create a reminder for the user specified in the **Owner** field of the page.\n2. Select the **Remind reporter** checkbox to create a reminder for the user specified in the **Reporter** field.\n3. Specify the date and time when the user should see the reminder.\n4. Save the record.\nIf the activity is not completed, Creatio will display the notification in the notification center at the specified time for the user selected in the **Owner** or **Author** field.\n### Process reminders\u200b\nThe notifications on the ![btn_com_notification_center_reminders00004.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_reminders00004.png) tab of the notification center are active until they are processed. You can cancel a reminder or postpone it. Process all reminders at once or separately.\nSelect the **Postpone** option from the menu and specify the period to **postpone a reminder** (Fig. 1). As a result, Creatio will remove the reminder from the list, and the number of unread reminders in the count will decrease. The reminder will be reactivated at the end of the specified period.\nFig. 1 Postpone a reminder\n![Fig.\u00a01 Postpone a reminder](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/communications/scr_notifications_reminder_postpone.png)\nSelect the **Cancel** option from the menu to **cancel a reminder** (Fig. 2). Creatio will no longer display the reminder in the notification center.\nFig. 2 Cancel a reminder\n![Fig.\u00a02 Cancel a reminder](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/communications/scr_notifications_reminder_cancel.png)\nnote\nCreatio will cancel a reminder automatically if the activity reaches its final status, for example, \"Completed,\" and the invoice reaches its final payment status, for example, \"Paid.\"\nUse the **Postpone all** or **Cancel all** option on the notification tab to **process all reminders** simultaneously.\n## Feed notifications\u200b\nCreatio will display a feed notification if someone mentions you in a post, comments on your record in the feed, or likes the record. Creatio displays the feed notifications on the ![btn_com_notification_center_feed00005.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_feed00005.png) tab in the notification center. The number on the tab displays the total number of unread feed messages.\nThe tab gives notifications about the following **events** :\n* Someone commented on your record in the feed.\n* Someone mentioned you in a post or a comment.\n* Someone liked your post or comment.\nAfter you open the tab, Creatio will mark all new notifications as read and remove them from the tab notification count. If you receive a new notification when the tab is open, it will be marked as read immediately.\n## Approval notifications\u200b\nUse the ![btn_com_notification_center_approvals00006.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_approvals00006.png) tab of the notification center to receive information about records that need to be approved. For example, contracts. The notification tab displays the total number of records to be approved. The name of the notification corresponds to the record that must be approved. Notifications also display the date and time of submission for approval. Click the approval title to view the record page.\nAll notifications on the ![btn_com_notification_center_approvals00007.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_approvals00007.png) tab in the notification center are active until they are processed. You can approve the record, reject an approval, or delegate the approval to someone else. After the approval is processed, Creatio will remove the notification from the tab and update the notification count.\nProcess approvals using the approval actions menu (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 The approval actions menu\n![Fig.\u00a03 The approval actions menu](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/communications/scr_notifications_communication_panel_approval_menu.png)\n* **Approve** \u2013 sets a positive result for the approval.\nnote\nBy default, approval comments are optional. Edit the \"Accept approval without comment\" (\"AcceptApprovalWithoutComment\" code) system setting to make the **Comment** field required.\n* **Reject** \u2013 sets a negative result for the approval.\nIf you choose to reject the approval, Creatio will open a pop-up box where you can enter your comments. For example, specify the rejection reason. The comment will be displayed on the approval page.\n* **Change approver** \u2013 assigns a different user as the approver. This action opens a window where you can select the user or user group. Approvers can be changed only if the **Approval may be delegated** is selected for this approval in the Process Designer.\nnote\nYou can also process an approval using the [**Approvals** tab](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1765#title-2141-6) or the [action panel](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1765#title-2141-5) on the page of the required document.\n## Noteworthy event notifications\u200b\nCreatio reminds you about upcoming noteworthy events of your colleagues and customers in the ![btn_com_notification_center_noteworthy_events00008.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_noteworthy_events00008.png) tab of the notification center. That way you will never miss the customer's birthday or the partner company's foundation day. The tab count displays the total number of unread notifications about noteworthy events.\nThe tab displays notifications about **noteworthy events of contacts and accounts** from the current day through until the next two business days.\nnote\nYou can change the period for which Creatio will display the notifications in the \"Noteworthy events notification period, days\" (\"NoteworthyEventNotificationPeriod\" code) system setting. The period is two days by default.\nThe history of read noteworthy event notifications is stored on this tab for a month since their creation.\nYou will receive notifications for the following contacts and accounts:\n* Contacts and accounts owned by you.\n* Contacts of \"Employee\" type or those for whom \"Our company\" is specified as an account.\n* The main contacts of the accounts owned by you.\n* Contacts and accounts specified in the orders owned by you. The orders must have \"Draft,\" \"Confirmation,\" or \"In progress\" status.\n* The contacts and accounts specified in opportunities owned by you (by the **Customer** field and the **Contacts** detail of the opportunity). Creatio will send notifications for opportunities that have not been closed yet as well as opportunities won during the last half-year.\nnote\nYou can change the period for won opportunities in the \"Noteworthy event notification period for opportunity participants, months\" (\"NoteworthyPeriodForOpportunityParticipants\" code) system setting. The period is six months by default.\n* The contacts and accounts specified in activities owned by you (by the **Account** field and the **Participants** detail of the activity). The activity must have a \"Not started\" or \"In progress\" status.\nThe noteworthy event notification list is updated every 24 hours. If you are assigned as the contact, account, or opportunity owner, you will receive an upcoming event notification instantly.\nClick the hyperlink in the notification to **view additional information** about a contact or an account. This will open a contact or account page. If you need to perform any action connected to the upcoming event, e. g. plan greetings, create a corresponding activity. To do this, select the **New task** option in the actions menu.\n## System messages\u200b\nCreatio displays the system messages on the ![btn_com_notification_center_system_notifications00010.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_notifications/btn_com_notification_center_system_notifications00010.png) tab. These messages do not require your attention. For example, they can be about successful Excel import, contact and account duplicates search results, or bulk email sending. System administrators will also see the license extension notifications on this tab.\nThe tab count displays the total number of unread system messages. If you open the tab, all system messaged will be considered read, and Creatio will reset the tab count. The history of read notifications is stored on the tab for a month since their creation.\n## Business process tasks\u200b\nKeep track of the steps linked to a [business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7098) or a case owned by you from the **Business process tasks** tab on the communication panel. Click the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/images/2020-11/btn_com_process_tasks.png) button to view the business process step notifications. The counter of the ![](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/images/2020-11/btn_com_process_tasks.png) button displays the total number of steps that require your attention.\nThe notifications display business process and case steps (also known as \"user actions\") that require your direct input. For example, complete an activity, send emails, edit records, fill out pre-configured pages, etc. The tab displays the steps that meet the following criteria:\n* You are an owner of the step or have the role to which the task was assigned.\n* The process step status is \"Running.\"\nBy default, the tab displays notifications about the steps due through until the current day. Select the \"Show future tasks\" checkbox at the top of the notification panel to view all notifications.\nIf the task is assigned to a role, use the quick actions menu to:\n* start processing the task\n* assign the task to yourself to finish it later\n* assign the task to another employee\nIf you have an open task page or a page that requires your direct input and a different user completes it, Creatio will display a corresponding notification in a dialog box.\nFig. 4 Process a group task on the communication panel\n![Fig.\u00a04 Process a group task on the communication panel](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/communications/working_with_group_tasks.png)\nnote\nYou can assign process tasks to other users or roles on the activity page as well.
