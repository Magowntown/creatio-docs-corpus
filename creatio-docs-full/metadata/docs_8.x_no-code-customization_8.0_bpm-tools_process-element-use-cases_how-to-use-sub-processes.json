  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: intermediate\nSub-processes can be used to run a process as a part of another process.\n## Add a sub-process\u200b\nExample\nA sale process (Fig. 1) must have a subordinate process for conducting a meeting with a customer (Fig. 2).\nFig. 1 Sale process\n![Fig.\u00a01 Sale process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_process_sales.png)\nFig. 2 Customer meeting process\n![Fig.\u00a02 Customer meeting process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_ask_conditional_variants.png)\nAdding a meeting sub-process (Fig. 1) to the opportunity process.\n1. Place the **Sub-process** element on the diagram after the \"Add opportunity\" element.\n2. On the element setup area, in the **Process** field, select the process that must be run on executing this element (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3 Selecting a process to be run as a sub-process\n![Fig.\u00a03 Selecting a process to be run as a sub-process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_choose_subprocess_name.png)\n3. Save the process diagram.\nAs a result, when the parent opportunity process is run, the items preceding the sub-process will be completed first, then the sub-process (meeting with client) will be started. After the sub-process is completed, the parent process will continue (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4 Sale process with enabled meeting subprocess\n![Fig.\u00a04 Sale process with enabled meeting subprocess](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_process_sales_with_subprocess_presentation.png)\nTo make the parent process execution depend on the subprocess result, add parameters that will be used for creating outgoing conditional flows of the sub-process element.\n## Obtain subprocess execution result\u200b\nThe parent process can pass parameter values to its sub-processes and get subprocess parameter values. Corresponding custom parameters must be added both to the parent process and the sub-process.\nExample\nIf the meeting result is that the customer showed interest, then a new order must be created in the parent process. If the customer is not interested, then the parent process must end.\nnote\nThe procedure for adding an order via the **Open edit page** element is covered in the previous article. The contract page settings are similar to those of a new document page.\nTo pass parameter values between the processes, first add corresponding custom parameters to both processes.\n### Add a parameter\u200b\nTo add a parameter to the meeting process (Fig. 2)\n1. Open the \"Meeting with customer\" process for editing and double-click on the working area of the Process Designer.\nnote\nYou can open the subprocess diagram from the **Sub-process** element setup area by clicking the button next to the **Process** field.\n2. In the **Actions** menu of the Process Designer, select **Process parameters** command.\n3. Click the **Add parameter** button and select the **Lookup** menu item.\n4. Populate process parameter properties (Fig. 5):\nFig. 5 The properties for the process parameter\n![Fig.\u00a05 The properties for the process parameter](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_subprocess_param_field.png)\n1. Enter the parameter name.\n2. In the **Lookup** field, select the **Activity result** lookup.\n3. Specify the value source of the parameter.\n1. Click the **Value** field and select **Process parameter** in the value menu.\n2. Select the **Activity result** parameter of the **Call customer** element as a source of the process parameter value (Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 Setting up process parameter value source\n![Fig.\u00a06 Setting up process parameter value source](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_subprocess_result_param.png)\n4. Click the **Select** button of the parameter value window.\n5. Save the process parameter.\n6. Save the process.\nAs a result, whenever the **Call customer** element is completed, its result will be passed to the process parameter.\n### Obtain results\u200b\nTo specify conditions for the conditional flow that originated from the **Sub-process** element in the parent process (Fig. 2):\n1. Open the parent process where the end parameter of another sub-process should be handled.\n2. Add conditional flow from the **Sub-process** element to the **Open edit page** element that open a new document page.\n3. Click the **Condition to move down the flow** field.\n4. In the parameter value window, specify the condition for moving down the flow that compares the sub-process resulting parameter with the expected value (Fig. 7):\nFig. 7 Condition for a conditional flow\n![Fig.\u00a07 Condition for a conditional flow](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_conditional_formula.png)\n1. On the **Process elements** tab, select **Meeting with customer**.\n2. Select the **Conduct meeting** process parameter.\n3. In the formula area, enter \"==.\"\n4. On the **Lookup** tab, select **Result of activity** lookup from the dropdown list.\n5. Select **Completed**.\n5. Save the changes in the parameter value window.\n6. Add a default flow from the subprocess element to the end process event element (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 The meeting sub-process on the parent process diagram\n![Fig.\u00a08 The meeting sub-process on the parent process diagram](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_process_sub_conditionals.png)\n7. Save the process diagram.\n## Use an event sub-process\u200b\nYou can set up business processes containing task combinations that can be repeated several times during the process execution, when certain events occur. To arrange such task combinations in a separate process flow, use the **Event sub-process** element in your diagram.\nFor example, within a sale process, order information must be updated at every stage of negotiations (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Sale process containing an Order modification event sub-process\n![Fig.\u00a09 Sale process containing an Order modification event sub-process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_sale_process_with_event_sub.png)\nTo set up a process containing an \"Order modification\" event sub-process:\n1. Add a [**Throw message** intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7033) to the process diagram after the corresponding process action. Populate the **Which message to generate?** field with the message name that will serve a trigger of your event sub-process, e.g. \"UpdateOrder\" (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 Populating the Which message to generate field of the Throw message event in the current process\n![Fig.\u00a010 Populating the Which message to generate field of the Throw message event in the current process](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_throw_message_field_value.png)\n2. Add the [**Event sub-process** element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7042) to the diagram and set up the elements on it (Fig. 11):\nFig. 11 Event sub-process element\n![Fig.\u00a011 Event sub-process element](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_event_sub.png)\n3. Add a [**Message** start event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7026) in the **Event sub-process** area on the diagram, as the initial event of your event sub-process. Make sure that the value in its **Which message event should start the process?** field matches the value of the message generated by the corresponding **Throw message** event (Fig. 12).\nFig. 12 Populating the Which message event should start the process field of the Message start event in the event sub-process area\n![Fig.\u00a012 Populating the Which message event should start the process field of the Message start event in the event sub-process area](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_sub_process/scr_process_creation_designer_message_start_field_value.png)\n1. Add subprocess steps to the diagram For example, add an [**Open edit page**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7012) element that opens the order page for the user and a **Send email** element to notify all involved parties that the order has been updated.\n2. Connect the event sub-process elements with sequence flows.\n4. Save the process diagram.\nnote\nThe event sub-process will be triggered each time the **Message** start event receives a corresponding message generated during the execution of the current process. Running event sub-process will not interrupt the execution of the current process: the event sub-process elements will be performed as regular process elements in the order defined by the user.\nAs a result, the event sub-process will launch each time the **Throw message** intermediate event of the current process generates a corresponding message during the process execution. For example, an order modification sub-process will run whenever an order modification message is received within the process.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Event sub-process element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7042)\n[Throw message intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7033)\n[Message start event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7026)\n[Create an email template](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2080)",
