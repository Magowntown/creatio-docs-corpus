For example, this includes cookies that let you log in to secure areas. Strictly necessary cookies facilitate the operation of Creatio Services and websites. Without these cookies, parts of Creatio Services and websites will not function properly.\n* **Functional cookies** that remember choices you make and recognize you when you return. This enables Creatio to personalize content, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region) or allow the pre-population of certain resource request forms, making it easier for you to access Creatio content.\n* **Analytical / performance** cookies that collect information about how you use Creatio Services. They allow Creatio to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around in Creatio Services. This helps us improve the way software works. These cookies may be sometimes placed by third-party providers of web traffic analysis services.\nLearn more details on cookies and how Creatio processes cookie data: [Creatio Privacy Policy](https://www.creatio.com/privacy-policy).\nThis article covers only cookies used by Creatio Services, but does not include cookies found in Creatio Marketplace Applications.
