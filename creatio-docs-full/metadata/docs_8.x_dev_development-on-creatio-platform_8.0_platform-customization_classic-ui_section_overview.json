  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.0\nOn this page\nLevel: beginner\nA **section** is a UI element that represents a specific business entity and contains a set of records. For example, **Accounts** , **Contacts** , **Activities** , etc. Sections are available from the side panel. You can group sections into workplaces to improve usability for particular roles. Learn more about sections in the user documentation guide: [Section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/8.0/category/section).\n## Section containers\u200b\nCreatio stores section UI elements in the corresponding containers. Containers are configured in the base schema of the section or replacing view model schema of the section. Containers depend on the section view.\nSections have the following **views** :\n* Section list\n* Section analytics\nnote\nCreatio uses HTML container meta names. It generates actual IDs that match the HTML elements of the section based on the meta names.\nView the main section **list containers** in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_01.png)\nView the main section **analytics containers** in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_02.png)\n* The action button container (`ActionButtonsContainer`) contains the section action button and the drop-down action list button.\n* The filter container (`QuickFilterViewContainer`) contains filters and tags.\n* The container of the section list view (`GridDataViewContainer`) contains section records. Record edit, copy, and delete action buttons reside in the active list record. Displayed in the section list.\n* The section analytics view container (`AnalyticsDataViewContainer`) contains the section dashboards. Displayed in the section analytics.\n## Section structure\u200b\nSections have the following **components** :\n* **List**. A component that displays the section record index in tile or list view. Displayed in the `GridDataViewContainer` container.\n* **Analytics**. A component that visualizes statistical data using charts, singular metrics, or lists. Dashboard blocks and custom dashboards are displayed in the `AnalyticsDataViewContainer` container.\n* **Actions**. A functional element that represents a set of operations with the active section list record. Call actions using buttons located in the `ActionButtonsContainer` container and active section list record.\n* **Filter**. A tool for condition-based data search and segmentation. Displayed in the `QuickFilterViewContainer` container.\n* **Tag**. A label for manual record segmentation. Displayed in the `QuickFilterViewContainer`, similar to the filter.\n### List\u200b\nA **list** is a UI element that displays the index of records added to the section or detail. For example, a contact index in the **Contacts** section.\nSection lists come in the following **types** :\n* **Vertical list**. Enables users to switch between records without closing the page.\n* **Editable list**. Enables users to edit records directly in the list without opening the pages.\nA section list has the following **views** :\n* **Tile view**. Displays list record fields over multiple rows. Default view.\n* **List view**. Displays records as a simple table. Each record corresponds to a single row. The display order of fields can differ between the list and tile views.\nView the tile view of the **Contacts** section list in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_sectiongrid_01_en.png)\nView the list view of the **Contacts** section list in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_sectiongrid_02_en.png)\nEach section corresponds to a configuration schema. The schema describes the structure of the corresponding database table with record data and contains specific instructions on processing the data. For example, the `ContactSectionV2` schema configures the **Contacts** section. All section schemas inherit from the `BaseSectionV2` base section schema. Each table row loosely corresponds to a section list record. For example, the **Contacts** section corresponds to the `Contact` business object schema that contains the index and properties of the `[Contact]` table rows. By default, the section list does not display every column of the corresponding database table. This is done to keep the displayed data easily digestible. You can view every column on the section [record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15521).\nEdit the appearance of the list, the index of displayed fields, and the sorting of data in the drop-down menu of the section toolbar\u2019s **View** button. Learn more in the user documentation: [Work with record lists](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1016).\n### Analytics\u200b\nThe **purpose** of section analytics is to analyze the statistical data of the section. By default, Creatio displays the list section view. To **switch to the analytics section view** , click the **Dashboards** button next to the section name. To **open the analytics view of all sections** , open the **Dashboards** section.\nView an example of **Activities** section analytics in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_analitycs.png)\n**Dashboards** display analytical data. Learn more about dashboards in a separate article and the user documentation guide: [Dashboard widgets](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15602), [Analytics](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/8.0/category/analytics). Dashboards are located on **dashboard tabs**. Learn more about dashboard tabs in the user documentation: [Add analytics in section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1405).\n### Actions\u200b\n**Section actions** are functional elements that represent an index of operations with one or more list records. You can run actions using buttons of different types. The buttons are located both in the action container of the current section and the container of the active record.\nView the **Contacts** section actions in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_basic_elements.png)\nSection actions have the following **types** :\n* standard\n* additional\nThe **standard Contacts** section actions are as follows:\n* **New contact**. Opens a pop-up box that lets you add and save a new section record.\n* **Open**. Opens the page of the active section record.\n* **Copy**. Opens a section record page, copies the active record data into the page, and creates a new record when you click **Save**.\n* **Delete**. Deletes the active record.\n* **Select multiple records**. Selects multiple list records.\n* **Select all**. Selects all list records.\n* **Export to Excel**. Exports all list records of the current section to an *.xlsx file. Learn more about data export in the user documentation: [Excel data export](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1864).\n* **Data import**. Imports data from an *xlsx file into Creatio. Learn more about data import in the user documentation: [Excel data import](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1252).\n* **Change log setup**. Opens the logging management page that also lets you select the section columns to log when a record is edited.\n**Additional** actions implement the functionality that depends on the section business logic. Additional **Contacts** section actions are as follows:\n* **Synchronize now**. Synchronizes Creatio with Google contacts. Creatio synchronizes only records tagged as per the synchronization settings. Learn more about contact synchronization in the user documentation: [Synchronize contacts and activities with Google](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1424).\n* **Add new account for synchronization**. Synchronizes Creatio Cloud with Google. Learn more about synchronization in the user documentation: [Synchronize contacts and activities with Google](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1424).\n* **Add to folder**. Opens a pop-up box that lets you select a folder where to place the active record.\n* **Exclude from folder**. Excludes the active record from all of its current folders.\n* **Show duplicate 'Contacts'**. Opens an additional page that contains all likely duplicates of the contacts. Creatio adds records to this page automatically after performing the duplicate search.\n* **Show on map**. Lets you display the location of selected contacts on the map. The action opens a box with a map that marks the contacts selected in the list. If the address fields of the selected contacts are empty, Creatio does not perform the action. If the address fields of some contacts are empty or filled out incorrectly, the box displays the corresponding information.\n* **Update the values in the 'Age' column**. Updates the **Age** column on the active contact page.\n* **Schedule daily update of the 'Age' column**. Opens a pop-up box that lets you set up the time of the daily contact age update.\n* **Mark all email addresses as valid**. Selects the **Valid** checkbox for the email address of the active contact record.\n### Filters\u200b\nA **filter** is a tool for condition-based data search and segmentation. You can use filters as an individual tool in Creatio sections. Filters are also available as part of other tools, for example, when you set up dynamic folders, dashboards, or business processes. Creatio displays filter controls above the section list. Learn more about filters in the user documentation: [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1017).\nFilters have the following **types** :\n* quick filter\n* advanced filter\n* standard filter\nConfigure the quick filter on the toolbar. Configure the standard and advanced filters in the **Filters/folders** menu.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_filters01_en.png)\n**Quick filter** is available in certain Creatio sections. Use quick filters to filter data by the most frequently used parameters (typically, by the date and owner). For example, the **Activities** section includes a quick filter since you most often need to view the activity of a single employee during the specified period. Learn more about the quick filter in the user documentation: [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1232&anchor=title-1755-1).\nTo **set the quick filter** , select the period to filter the section list records in the **Select period** drop-down menu.\nView an example of a quick filter that filters activities by current month (the **Select period** drop-down menu is set to **Current month**) in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_quick_filters.png)\n**Standard filter** lets you search for records by the values of one or more current section columns quickly. Available in most section lists. Learn more about the standard filter in the user documentation: [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1233&anchor=title-1755-4).\nTo **set the standard filter** :\n* Select **Add filter** in the **Filters/folders** drop-down menu.\n* Select the field and field value to filter the section list records.\nView an example of a standard filter that filters activities by account (the **Account** field is set to **Estron**) in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_filters02.png)\n**Advanced filter** consists of several parameters and complex search conditions. For example, you can use the advanced filter to display meetings with new customers in the **Activities** section. You can also save the parameters and conditions of an advanced filter as a dynamic folder to reuse them later. Learn more about the advanced filter in the user documentation: [Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1234&anchor=title-1755-10).\nTo **set the advanced filter** :\n* Select **Switch to advanced mode** in the **Filters/folders** drop-down menu.\n* Select the object, object column, and column value to filter the section list records.\nView an example of an advanced filter that filters activities by account (the **Name** field of the **Account** object is set to **Novelty**) and job title (the **Job title** field of the **Contact** object is set to **Specialist**) in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_filters03.png)\nA **folder** is a filtering tool that groups records by specific conditions. Folders can have hierarchical structure. Learn more about folders in the user documentation: [Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1018).\nFolders have the following **types** :\n* **Dynamic folders**. Contain only the section records that match the specified filter conditions. For example, you can filter records by creation date to create a **New customers** dynamic folder. Creatio generates and updates the content of such folders automatically.\n* **Static folders**. Contain only the section records added by users, manually or as part of the conversion from a dynamic folder. For example, you can create a **VIP customers** static folder to ensure sales associates or their managers make personal decisions to add customers to the folder.\nYou can only add records to or remove them from static folders. Creatio adds a record to a folder automatically if the record meets the filter conditions of the folder. If a record no longer meets the filter conditions of the folder, Creatio removes the record from the folder automatically.\nTo **set up a folder** :\n* Select **Show folders** in the **Filters/folders** drop-down menu.\n* Select the folder to filter the section list records.\nView an example folder that includes contacts not connected to accounts (the **Contacts not connected to accounts** folder) in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_filters04.png)\n### Tags\u200b\nA **tag** is a special label you can use to segment records manually. For example, you can tag records in the **Contacts** section to mark VIP customers or ban customers. Tag records manually. To **select a tag** , click **Tag** and select a tag to filter the section list records. Learn more about tags in the user documentation: [Tags](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1881).\nCreatio provides the following tag **types** :\n* **Private** tags. Only visible and accessible to the user who created them. Any user can create any number of private tags. Private tags are not visible to managers and system administrators. Creatio marks private tags green.\n* **Corporate** tags. Visible to the company employees. Any employee can add or remove a corporate tag. Any employee/role that has permissions for the **Corporate tags management** (`CanManageCorporateTags` code) operation can create corporate tags. Creatio marks corporate tags blue.\n* **Public** tags. Visible to the company employees, as well as self-service portal users. Any employee can add or remove a public tag. Any employee/role that has permissions for the **Public tags management** (`CanManagePublicTags` code) operation can create public tags. Creatio marks public tags red.\nView an example of contacts that are VIP customers (**VIP customer** tag selected) in the figure below.\n![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/Section/7.18/scr_intro_ui_section_tag.png)\n## Create a section\u200b\nYou can create a section in the Section Wizard. To create a section, follow the instructions in the user documentation: [Create a new section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1245).\nView object schemas and client schemas that the Section Wizard creates in the user-made package when you add a section in the table below.\nSchemas that the Section Wizard creates\nName| Purpose| Parent object  \n---|---|---  \nObject schemas  \n`[Section object name]`| The primary section object| `BaseEntity` base object.  \n`[Section object name]Folder`| The object folder. A utility object that ensures the correct grouping of section records. Structures the section folder tree.| `BaseFolder` base folder.  \n`[Section object name]InFolder`| The object in the folder. A utility object that ensures grouping section records operates as intended. Defines links between section records and their folders.| `BaseItemInFolder` base element in the folder.  \n`[Section object name]File`| The object for the **Attachments** detail.| `File` file.  \n`[Section object name]Tag`| The section tag.| `BaseTag` base tag.  \n`[Section object name]InTag`| The tag in the section object.| `BaseEntityInTag` base tag in the base object.  \nClient schemas  \n`[Section object name]Section`| The section schema.| `BaseSectionV2` base section schema.  \n`[Section object name]Page`| The schema of the section record page.| `BaseModulePageV2` base schema of the section record page.  \n## Add a custom column to the section list\u200b\nTo add a custom column to the section list, add a column to the schema of the section business object. When you add a custom column, Creatio adds a replacing view model schema to the current package. The schema inherits the base object columns. The custom column is added to the schema.\nYou can use the following **tools** to add a custom column to the schema of the section business object:\n* Section Wizard\n* Creatio IDE\nTo add a custom column to the section list in the **Section Wizard** , follow the instructions in the user documentation: [Work with record lists](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1016&anchor=title-756-9).\nTo add a custom column to the section page in **Creatio IDE** :\n1. Create a replacing view model schema of the section page to place the custom column. To do this, follow the guide in a separate article: [Implement a replacing module](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15106&anchor=title-3028-4).\n2. Select the view model schema to replace as the parent object.\n3. Add a custom column of the corresponding type to the replacing view model schema of the section page.\n4. Set up the appearance of the custom column in the section list.\n## Set up the appearance conditions of the section list\u200b\nCreatio lets you set up the appearance conditions of the section list. Record lists that match the specified conditions are displayed in line with the configured visual styles.\nTo **set up the appearance conditions of the section list** :\n1. Create a replacing view model schema of the section page. To do this, follow the guide in a separate article: [Implement a replacing module](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15106&anchor=title-3028-4).\n2. Select the view model schema to replace as the parent object.\n3. Set up the **appearance conditions of the section list**. To do this, implement the `prepareResponseCollectionItem()` method in the `methods` property. The method overloads the base method and modifies the data row before uploading the row to the list. Implement the assignment of a specific value to the `customStyle` property in the method. The property controls the list row appearance. The property is an object that has child properties that are similar to CSS properties and generate the visual style of the relevant list records.\nView an example of the `customStyle` property setup below.\nExample of the customStyle property setup\nitem.customStyle = {  \n/* Set the text color to white. */  \n\"color\": \"white\",  \n/* Set the background color to orange. */  \n\"background\": \"orange\"  \n};  \n## Add a section record action\u200b\nCreatio lets you add custom actions for either a single record or multiple records. The `BaseSectionV2` schema of the `NUI` package implements the base content of the **Actions** drop-down menu on the section page.\nTo **add an action for a single section record** :\n1. Create a replacing view model schema of the section page. To do this, follow the guide in a separate article: [Implement a replacing module](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15106&anchor=title-3028-4).\n2. Select the view model schema to replace as the parent object.\n3. The section action index is an instance of the `Terrasoft.BaseViewModelCollection` class. Each item of the action index is a view model. Set up the action in the configuration object that lets you both set the properties of the action view model explicitly and use the base binding mechanism.\nImplement the **menu item behavior**. To do this, implement the `getSectionActions()` overloaded parent schema method in the `methods` property. The method returns the collection of section actions. When you replace base sections in the `getSectionActions()` method of the replacing module, call the parent implementation of the method to initialize the actions of the parent section. To do this, execute the `this.callParent(arguments)` method that returns the action collection of the base section.\nTo add an action to the collection, call the `addItem()` method. The `getButtonMenuItem()` callback method is passed to the method as a parameter. The method creates an instance of the action view model by the configuration object passed to the method as the parameter.\nReference the selected record via the `ActiveRow` attribute of the section view model. The attribute returns the primary column value of the selected record. In turn, you can use the primary column value of the selected record to get the values uploaded to the field list of the selected object.\nThe `SelectedRows` property of the section view model stores the primary column values of the selected records. You can use these values to get the values uploaded to the field list of selected objects. For example, from a regular list\u2019s data collection stored in the `GridData` view model property of the list.\nView the base implementation of action addition below.\nBaseSectionV2\n/**  \n* Returns the collection of section actions in the list view mode.  \n* @protected  \n* @virtual  \n* @return {Terrasoft.BaseViewModelCollection} The section action collection.  \n*/  \ngetSectionActions: function() {  \n/* The action collection. An instance of Terrasoft.BaseViewModelCollection. */  \nvar actionMenuItems = this.Ext.create(\"Terrasoft.BaseViewModelCollection\");   \n/* Add an action to the collection. Pass the method that instantiates the action model instance to the passed configuration object as callback. */  \nactionMenuItems.addItem(  \nthis.getButtonMenuItem({  \n/* The configuration object that sets up the action. */  \n...  \n})  \n);  \nreturn actionMenuItems;  \n}  \nView the properties of the section action\u2019s configuration object that is passed as a parameter to the `getButtonMenuItem()` method in the table below.\nConfiguration object properties\nProperty| Description  \n---|---  \n`Type`| The type of the **Actions** drop-down menu item. The property lets you add a horizontal line that separates menu blocks to the action menu. To do this, specify `Terrasoft.MenuSeparator` as the property value. If you do not specify the property value, Creatio adds a menu item by default.  \n`Caption`| The title of the **Actions** menu item. We recommend using [localizable strings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15272&anchor=title-2174-3) for titles.  \n`Click`| Binds an action handler method by the method name.  \n`Enabled`| The boolean property that controls the menu item availability.  \n`Visible`| The boolean property that controls the menu item visibility.  \n## Set up the quick filters block of the section\u200b\nCreatio lets you implement a custom quick filters block for section list records.\nTo **set up the quick filters block of the section** :\n1. Create a replacing view model schema of the section page. To do this, follow the guide in a separate article: [Implement a replacing module](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15106&anchor=title-3028-4).\n2. Select the view model schema to replace as the parent object.\n3. Implement the **filtering behavior**. To do this, implement the `initFixedFiltersConfig()` method in the `methods` property. The method initializes the fixed filters. In the method, create a configuration object that has an array of filters. Assign the object link to the `fixedFiltersConfig` attribute of the view model.\n## Delete a section\u200b\n1. Make sure you have access to Creatio configuration and database.\n2. Unlock the file that corresponds to the relevant section in the SVN repository.\n3. Delete the section that is based on the relevant object. To do this, execute an SQL query.\n* MSSQL\n* PostgreSQL\nDECLARE @UId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER  \nDECLARE @ModuleEntityUID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;  \nDECLARE @ModuleID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;  \nDECLARE @Name NVARCHAR(max) = 'ToDelete';  \nselect @UId = UId from SysSchema where Name Like @Name  \nselect @ModuleEntityUID = Id from SysModuleEntity where  \nSysEntitySchemaUId = @UId  \nselect @ModuleID = Id from SysModule where SysModuleEntityId = @ModuleEntityUID;  \ndelete from SysModuleInWorkplace where SysModuleId = @ModuleID;  \ndelete from SysModule where Id = @ModuleID;  \ndelete from SysModuleEdit where SysModuleEntityId = @ModuleEntityUID;  \ndelete from SysModuleEntity where Id = @ModuleEntityUID;  \ndelete from SysDetail where EntitySchemaUId = @UId;  \ndelete from SysLookup where SysEntitySchemaUId = @UId;  \ndelete from [Lookup] where SysEntitySchemaUId = @UId;  \ndo $$  \nDECLARE  \nname varchar(100) = 'UsrProperty';  \nmoduleID UUID;  \nmoduleEntityUID UUID;  \nuId UUID;  \nBEGIN  \nuId = (select \"UId\" from \"SysSchema\" where \"Name\" Like name);  \nmoduleEntityUID = (select \"Id\" from \"SysModuleEntity\" where  \n\"SysEntitySchemaUId\" = uId);  \nmoduleID = (select \"Id\" from \"SysModule\" where \"SysModuleEntityId\" = moduleEntityUID);  \nupdate \"SysModule\" set \"Image32Id\"=Null where \"Id\" = moduleID;  \ndelete from \"SysModuleInWorkplace\" where \"SysModuleId\" = moduleID;  \ndelete from \"SysModule\" where \"Id\" = moduleID;  \ndelete from \"SysModuleEdit\" where \"SysModuleEntityId\" = moduleEntityUID;  \ndelete from \"SysModuleEntity\" where \"Id\" = moduleEntityUID;  \ndelete from \"SysDetail\" where \"EntitySchemaUId\" = uId;  \ndelete from \"SysLookup\" where \"SysEntitySchemaUId\" = uId;  \ndelete from \"Lookup\" where \"SysEntitySchemaUId\" = uId;  \nend $$;  \nReplace `ToDelete` with the name of the custom section schema.\n4. After you clear the database, delete the custom schemas from the **Configuration** section.\nDelete the configuration schemas in this **order** :\n1. `ToDeleteFile`.\n2. `ToDeleteInFolder`.\n3. `ToDeleteInTag`.\n4. `ToDeleteTag`.\n5. `ToDeleteFolder`.\n6. `ToDelete`.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Record page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15521)\n[Work with record lists](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1016) (user documentation)\n[Dashboard widgets](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15602)\n[Excel data export](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1864) (user documentation)\n[Excel data import](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1252) (user documentation)\n[Synchronize activities with Google](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1424) (user documentation)\n[Filters](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1234) (user documentation)\n[Folders](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1235) (user documentation)\n[Tags](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1881) (user documentation)\n[Create a new section](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=1705) (user documentation)\n[Configuration elements](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/8.0/category/configuration-elements)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Tech Hour - How to use buttons and actions to empower Creatio pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5zefAhN3fk)\n[Creatio section documentation](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/8.0/category/section)\n[Creatio section analytics documentation](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/8.0/category/analytics)",
