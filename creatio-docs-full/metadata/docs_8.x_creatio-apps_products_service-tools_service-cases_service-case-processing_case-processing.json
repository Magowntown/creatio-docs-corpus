  "content_markdown": "Version: 8.3Creatio Service\nOn this page\nProcess Creatio cases in the **Cases** section.\n## Start processing a case\u200b\nTo **begin working on a case** , select a case in the **Cases** section list. After you open the case, select the \"In progress\" status on the progress bar (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Start processing a case\n![Fig. 1 Start processing a case](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_change_case_stage_to_in_progress.png)\n**As a result** , Creatio will change the case status to \"In progress\" and specify the current user in the **Assignee** field. The customer will be notified that you started processing the case and given the resolution deadline via email.\nAfter you resolve the case, transfer it to the following stage using the progress bar.\n### Notify the assignee/assignee group about the case\u200b\nIf a case that has **Assignee** and/or **Assignees group** fields filled out becomes active, Creatio notifies the assignee/assignee group. Creatio also notifies the assignee/assignee group when the assignee/assignee group is specified for an active case.\nnote\nThe case is considered active if its status is \"New,\" \"In progress,\" \"Reopened.\"\nIf the **Assignee** field is filled out, Creatio notifies the assignee. The **Assignees group** field can be either empty or filled out.\nIf the **Assignees group** field is filled out and the **Assignee** field is not, Creatio notifies the assignee group. In this case, the **To** field is populated with emails of every group member.\nSet up the content of the notification sent to the assignee/assignee group in the **Message templates** lookup. By default, the notification uses the \"Specifying case assignee\" template.\n### Escalate a case\u200b\nTo **escalate a case** to a higher support level, click the **Escalate** button on the case page.\nFig. 2 Escalate a case\n![Fig. 2 Escalate a case](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_escalate_a_case.png)\nThis opens the escalation page. Specify the new support level as well as the assignee or assignee group on the page.\nA new assignee or an agent from the assignee group will continue processing the case.\n#### Reassign a case\u200b\nTo **reassign a case** , change the value in the **Assignee** or **Assignee group** field of the case page.\nA new assignee or an agent from the assignee group will continue processing the case.\n### Reclassify the case\u200b\nTo **reclassify the case** , click **Reclassify** on the case page, update the category, SLA, or service, and save the changes.\n## Communicate with the customer\u200b\nUse the message composer on the **Conversation** tab to **write and send replies** to the customer (Fig. 2). You can either send emails or post feed messages available for external users.\nFig. 3 Post a feed message for external users\n![Fig. 3 Post a feed message for external users](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_post_a_feed_message.png)\nClick the ![btn_attachment.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/btn_attachment.png) button to attach a file to an email or feed message.\nAfter you finish processing the case, for example, ask the customer for more information, change the case status to \"Waiting for response\" (Fig. 3). This indicates that the case is waiting for a customer's reply.\nFig. 4 Change the case status to Waiting for response\n![Fig. 4 Change the case status to Waiting for response](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_change_case_status_to_waiting_for_response.png)\nThe customer can reply via email or by posting a feed message. The reply appears on the **Conversation** tab (Fig. 4).\nCreatio reopens the case that has a non-final status automatically if the customer sends an email reply. The **Assignee** field is cleared and the case is returned to the processing queue.\nFig. 5 Customer communication history\n![Fig. 5 Customer communication history](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_customer_communication_history.png)\nYou can [dial](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1027) the customer via the [communication panel](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1011) if needed.\n## Resolution and feedback\u200b\nAfter you provide the customer with the resolution, change the case status to \"Resolved.\"\nFig. 6 Resolve the case\n![Fig. 6 Resolve the case](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_resolve_a_case.png)\nCreatio notifies the customer about the case resolution via email. The email also contains the user satisfaction scale. The customer can use it to grade the contact center or support service performance. Learn more: [Set up case resolution notification](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1787#title-198-4).\nCase status changes depending on the customer satisfaction level. For example:\n* If the satisfaction level is \"1\" or \"2,\" Creatio reopens the case, changes its status to \"Reopened,\" and clears the **Assignee** field.\n* If the satisfaction level is \"3,\" \"4,\" or \"5,\" Creatio changes the case status to \"Closed.\"\nnote\nConfigure the relationship between customer satisfaction levels and case statuses in the **Satisfaction levels** lookup.\n### Reopen the case automatically when receiving an email\u200b\nCreatio reopens the case automatically and clears the **Assignee** field if the following conditions are met:\n* The case status is **paused** or **resolved** yet its **status is not final**.\nnote\nConfigure incident and service request statuses in the **Case statuses** lookup. In this case, the status must have the **Pause status** or **Resolved status** checkbox selected yet the **Final status** checkbox cleared. By default, \"Resolved\" and \"Waiting for response\" statuses meet these criteria.\n* The customer **sent a case email**.\nIf Creatio receives an email, the case status is changed to \"Reopened\" automatically. Creatio also clears the **Assignee** field. This is done to enable other employees to work with the reopened case.\nnote\nIf the **Assignee group** field is not cleared, every group member receives a case notification.\n### Close cases automatically\u200b\nCreatio closes cases automatically if the following conditions are met:\n* The case status is \"Resolved.\"\n* The case's actual resolution time is filled out.\n* The waiting period for case evaluation ended.\nnote\nSpecify the waiting period for case evaluation in the \"Number of waiting days to reevaluate resolved case\" (\"FirstReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) and \"Number of waiting days after second reminder of resolved case\" (\"SecondReevaluationWaitingDays\" code) [system settings](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1259#title-1880-25).\nCreatio checks for cases that meet these conditions once a day. The status of every case that meets the conditions is changed to \"Closed.\" The automatic case closure procedure remains the same regardless of whether case evaluation is on or off.\nYou can disable the automatic case closure. To do this, clear the \"Default value\" checkbox in the \"Automatically close resolved cases\" (\"CloseResolvedCases\" code) [system setting](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1259#title-1880-25).\n## Cancel a case\u200b\nIf you created a case by mistake or the case no longer needs a response (for example, the customer resolved the issue on their own or the question is no longer relevant), select the **Canceled** stage on the progress bar to **cancel the case**.\nFig. 7 Cancel the case\n![Fig. 7 Cancel the case](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Composable_apps/CaseManagement/process_and_close_cases/scr_cancel_a_case.png)\n**As a result** , Creatio will change the case status to \"Canceled\" and notify the customer via email.\n* * *\n## See also\u200b\n[Create a case](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1613)\n[Set up response and resolution deadlines](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1654)\n[Set up \"Junk\" case registration](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1788)\n* * *\n## Resources\u200b\n[Service cases](https://academy.creatio.com/node/531198)",
